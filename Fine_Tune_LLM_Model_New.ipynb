        "(Utilizing the DistilBERT model from Hugging Face for sentiment analysis leverages the power of a streamlined, efficient version of BERT to classify text sentiment with remarkable accuracy and speed. DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT, maintains 97% of BERT's language understanding while being 60% faster and 40% smaller, making it ideal for sentiment analysis tasks where computational efficiency is crucial. To further enhance the model's performance, large language model (LLM) fine-tuning can be performed. This process involves training DistilBERT on a task-specific dataset, allowing the model to learn the nuances and intricacies of the specific sentiment analysis application, thereby improving its accuracy and robustness in real-world scenarios )\n",

This movie lacks any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have seemed old even in the fifties, the only thing it really has going for it is some pretty ladies, but really, if you want that you can rent something from the \\\"Adult\\\" section. OK?<br /><br />I can hardly see anything here to recommend since you'll probably have a lot a better and productive time chasing rats with a sledgehammer or inventing waterproof teabags or whatever.<br /><br />2/10\",\n          \"Guest from the Future tells a fascinating story of time travel, friendship, battle of good and evil -- all with a small budget, child actors, and few special effects. Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes. Not for the faint-hearted \\u0096 just the thick-headed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This film should be released at least to video, other generations can gain an appreciation of great music and story telling. The cast was made up of some of the greatest Black actors ever, most have now passed away; only Sidney P. is still with us.

A shockingly tragic ending may unnerve some younger viewers, but as a whole Kill Shot truly delivers a death blow.\",\n          \"Absolutely corrosive! Director Arthur Hiller and writer Paddy Chayefsky dismantle the American hospital system with this wicked comedy/drama/whodunit. The hospital depicted here is fraught with problems...from protesting neighbors to irate patients to a potential serial killer on the loose. George C. Scott is the top doctor who, on the brink of his own nervous breakdown, gets involved with free-spirited Diana Rigg and her wacky father Barnard Hughes. Alternately depressing and uproarious, THE HOSPITAL features some of the most acid-tinged dialog imaginable (note how Scott describes his love making session with Rigg). It also has a lot of great vignettes: Scott berating head nurse Nancy Marchand after one of here underlings accidentally kills a doctor; daffy administrator Frances Sternhagen trying desperately to collect insurance info from a waiting room full of sick people; Scott getting sobering advice from the hospital psychiatrist after telling him of his woeful home-life. All of the acting is first-rate. Scott and Rigg are dynamite and Hughes is a real surprise. The movie is a masterpiece with Chayefsky's script earning a well-deserved Oscar (over such stiff competition as KLUTE & Sunday, BLOODY Sunday). The opening narration is priceless.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This show is a total crud-pie! Belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn The women are physically attractive but too Stepford-is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer There is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local TV station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell Except Except for the wonderful comic sty lings of Larry Joe Campbell, America's Greatest Comic Character Actor This guy plays Belushi's brother-in-law, Andy, and he is gold How good is he really Well, aside from being funny, his job is to make Belushi look good That's like trying to make butt warts look good But Campbell pulls it off with style Someone should invent a Nobel Prize in Comic Buffoonery so he can win it every year Without Larry Joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking Courtney Thorne-Smith smacking Belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell designated Comedic Bacon because he improves the flavor of everything he's in!\n",

            "The most interesting thing about Miryang (Secret Sunshine) is the actors Jeon Do-yeon, as Lee Shin-ae, the main character, is a woman with a young son whose husband has died in a tragic accident, and who leaves Seoul to live in Miryang, which was his home town, with her young son Jeon's face is very changeable She is girlish, flirtatious, elegant, aged and sad, desperate and joyous, with it and terribly isolated by turns, and it's all in her face The film also stars Song Kang-ho as Kim, a man who meets her when her car breaks down coming into Miryang, who happens to run a garage in town, and who follows her around all the time thereafter, despite her apparent lack of interest in his attentions Song is the biggest star in Korea right now, renowned for his work with Park Chan-wook and Bong Joon-ho (Sympathy for Mr Vengeance; Memories of Murder and The Host) And yet here he plays a throwaway character, almost a forgotten man But of course he makes him interesting and curiously appealing He is the essential ballast to keep Jeon's character from floating awayLee Shin-ae is a piano teacher She comes to the new town, which is a neutral place, a kind of poor-man's Seoul, a town \"just like anywhere else,\" as Kim says (just as he is in a way just like anyone else) Her little boy is sprightly, as little boys are, but plainly damaged and withdrawn at times too His father used to snore, and when he misses him he lies awake, pretending to snore He goes to school, and Shin-ae meets parents and students and shopkeepers There is a sense of place in the film, even though the place is in a sense \"anywhere\" People speak in the local dialect, and everyone knows everything, and Shin-ae's Seoul origin is immediately noticed Is life really harsher here, away from the big city and its sophistication Shin-ae seems not to realize the danger she is inSomething terrible happens And Shin-ae doesn't necessarily deal with it in the best possible way But it happens and she must face the consequences But she can't She goes to pieces A perpetrator is caught, but that's no consolation Eventually she becomes so despairing, she relents and goes to a born-again Christian meeting an acquaintance has been pressing her to attend She finds peace and release with this But when she decides not only to forgive the perpetrator but to go to the prison to tell him so, that experience is full of ironies and it destroys her all over again She becomes embittered and desperate and she no longer finds solace in religion And it gets worse than thatJeon Do-yeon gives her all in this extremely demanding and protean role Lee Chang-dong may be a very good director If an actor of the stature of Song Kang-ho expresses enormous admiration for him, that is convincing According to Scott Foundas of LA Weekly, Lee's first three films, Green Fish (1997), Peppermint Candy (2000) and Oasis (2002) have marked him out as \"one of the leading figures of his country's recent cinematic renaissance\" But this is not as successful a film as those of other Korean directors whose work I've seen, such as Yong Sang-Soo, Bong Joon-ho, and the prodigiously, almost perversely gifted Park Chan-wook It may indeed begin as Foundas says as a kind of \"Asiatic Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\" and then \"abruptly and without warning\" turns into \"something of a thriller, and some time after that a nearly Bressonian study in human suffering\" But that progression not only seems random and indigestible; the film sags and loses its momentum toward the end and then simply fizzles out, with no sense of an ending There are also weaknesses in the action Shin-ae takes foolish chances with her son, and makes bad choices all along If she is destined for madness like Betty in Jean-Jacques Beineix's Betty Blue, which might explain her peculiar and mistaken choices, that isn't something that is properly developed This is an interesting film, certainly a disturbing one, but one that leaves one doubtful and dissatisfied, after putting one through an emotional wringerAn official selection of the New York Film Festival presented at Lincoln Center, 2007åÑan event that has done right by Korean filmmakers in the recent past\n",

            "I saw a screening of this movie last night I had high expectations going into it, but was definitely disappointed Within 5 minutes of the opening, Williams is already campaigning for his presidency And he becomes president in the first 40 minutes So there goes all that aspect of the movie The first half hour are hilarious Don't get me wrong, the movie has its moments But after the first half hour, it takes a turn for the worst It becomes less of a comedy, and more of a thriller/drama/love storywhich is pointless the movie goes nowhere and stands still for a good 30 minutes there are laughs interspersed here and there, but the consistently funny part is in the beginning and only the beginning at one point, the biggest cheer i heard in the audience is when a person in the crowd yelled 'boooo' during a very confusingly emotional scene Williams gives a great performance, right on par with his comedic style Walken also delivers a strong supporting role as only he can I think the one character that goes underrated is Lewis Black Consistently vulgar and political, its funny to see him tone it down for a PG-13 rating Overall, I would not pay to see the movie Afterall, I saw it for free and even I was disappointed The first half hour is solid, and its all downhill from there Not really fitting into a category, the movie realizes half way through that it should not have been anything more than a one-hour comedy central special 45/10\n",

            "I had a recent spectator experience with The Perfect Witness (2007) because the NetFlix computer recommendation engine suggested I watch this film Apparently, at some point, I told it how much I liked Michael Haneke's, Benny's Video I don't know about you, but this parallel being drawn provoked in me a maelstrom of emotion and excitement over Thomas C Dunn's film and made the allocation of my time toward it virtually impossible to refuse Just this kind of recommendation from the NetFlix computer intelligence, for me, had the aesthetic/moral movie bar set to level so high that, upon reflection, it represented something pretty much unaccomplished in every film produced in the year 2007Having prefaced my response to the film that way, I'm going to proceed in knocking this picture down as poorly executed and banal; and I really hate to do that because I think our boy, Wes Bentley, happens to be not only one of the most interesting young faces in contemporary cinema, but also one its most overlooked and underrated screenacting talents in the US I'm more than moderately concerned that the poor guy's going to miss the fame ship if he keeps fiddling around with first time movie directors like thisThe Perfect Witness is about Micky (Wes Bentley), who, about thirty, still lives with Mom (\"You're not drinkin' again area ya's\"), but he's a \"filmmaker\" or at the very least some kind of street-level voyeur with a pension for shooting would-be Johns in the seedy back alleys of Philadelphia with his DVX 100B Out there, doing his private investigator-like drills, Micky \"inadvertently\" video-tapes a brutal murder on a hapless early-twenty-ish coed with his hand held camcorder Baring the notion in mind that snuff and movies as cultural currency can be his equated with his ticket out of the white urban ghetto (and not to the debts of his unwitting friends and relatives who put up the money for his atrocious films), Micky approaches the assailant, James LeMac (Mark Borkowski: also takes a writing credit) or \"Mac the Knife\" åÐwhichever- and blackmails the killer into making a documentary about his murder impulses, holding this found footage over the attacker with threats of the policeThe problem with this movie is not that no interesting ideas exist because they do While both the writing and direction are amateurish, that alone doesn't make a film bad It's that these guys commit a rather poor assumption that what they are presenting is shocking in the context of a culture in which just about any person in the free world with access to a private computer can log-on to the web and catch the veracity of the action of a beheading on their little Mac or PC No film relies on shock value alone any more (unless of course, ironically, it's a film about torture on animals) and therefore cinematic images of violence (real or fake) have less and less cultural capital with each year that passes Also, we've got this astounding actor-talent in the lead all styled-up, real hip guy: his two inch beard and skull cap with the little bill on it, backwards, just like the dork from high school who craved after the potential services of my primary love interest åÐsame guy who just now calls himself a \"poet\"Spare me \"I'm an artist,\" \"I'm a filmmaker\" Okay Please do, carry on with that shtick, Cronnie Seems to have bought you a lot of expensive 35mm stock And go ahead, you can wear all the accrutements of a \"creative\" but don't expect us top respond to you, to follow your below average character through your two hour movie while you take down Wes Bentley's career Why don't we just let history speak to the merits of what you do, filmmaker guy My guess is history will eventually have say something about that åÐlike, probably that's in not is good as you think it is And yeah, odds are you'll be laying the blame on your dear ole ma, end up like our man Micky here in The Perfect Witness; hooked on smack and covered in your buddy's blood with a video camera in your hand Great\n",

Maybe it's because they became extinct millions of years before the invention of gunpowder, and the laws of physics were just different back then Aah, no Come on If they're close enough to chemically operate today, they'd have to be vulnerable to fast (even subsonic) lead projectiles It's that simpleLook, the toughest-skinned reptiles on the planet today, alligators and crocodiles, are completely vulnerable to basic rifle fire They're nothing magic You can shoot a pistol round right through the heavy scales on their backs They don't take armor-piercing bullets or anything special Small bullets penetrate them, they just don't kill them Somewhat (but not REALLY) large bullets are preferred because the challenge (as with most game) is to kill the animal with one shot, so it doesn't run (Hunters consider it immoral to allow prey to run off and die unharvested)Most animals, including predators, are easily repelled by gunfire Between the noise, and the pain of even a non-lethal wound, most will run away An exception are big bears, which are so fearless that they're merely enraged by mortal wounds Cape buffalo are regarded as highly dangerous because they are well known to charge when wounded We've seen video of the big bulls of a herd of cape buffalo rescuing a calf from an entire pride of lions A big cat will run if it can, but if it can't it will charge as a final act of desperation Where a TRex would fit in this spectrum is unknown Their behavior simply has not been observed With these larger animals, safe hunting becomes a matter of applying an appropriately large and powerful projectile, and/or applying several of them rapidly enough to counter its charge With a TRex, of course, this could be a serious problem I've seen a TRex skull (they have one in the museum downtown) and carrying a gun big enough to bust that might be impractical Chewing its neck off with lots of smaller fire might be a more viable approach Small bullets would still _penetrate_ them, they wouldn't just bounce off just because the animal is too big to easily kill! So here we have Cortez and his men (this is _before_ the famous Mexican campaign, apparently) captured by American natives and scheduled for sacrifice on the pyramid It appears that all those human sacrifices were about appeasing the bloodthirst of the pair of TRexes that terrorized the continent in the day Rather than just having their hearts cut out and being fed to the lizards, Cortez et al talk the Aztecs into letting them hunt & kill them OK, maybe they don't have M-16s like the guys in the \"Carnosaur\" series, but they _do_ have flintlocks, crossbows, pointed sticks (big ones, made from trees) and swords Maybe that's a little less uneven than squads of soldiers with full auto, but they've several guys and I'd quickly bet on them over a dinosaur Oh, wait, there's a _cannon_, about a 4-incher That's just the ticket for busting a Tyrannosaurus' skull! So they lay a trap, with a squad of men, cannon, pointed sticks in a ravine, and lure the first TRex into it, using a pretty brown girl as bait Cortez points out that they'll NOT have time to reload, so they'll have to close the range until they can be certain of their aim TRex totally ignores their volley of flintlock fire, and we see both a crossbow bolt _and_ the cannon ball _bounce_ off! Forget it End of credibility A crossbow bolt would defeat Cortez' torso armor, and a 4\" cannon ball might penetrate the hull of a wooden ship! This would also _certainly_ get through the hide, ribcage, or skull of any animal ever to walk this planet (Do you think a _whale_ could withstand a 4\" cannon ball) And here's TRex, still standing, not even bleeding So Cortez lures it to the ravine, where it falls onto the pointed sticks, which (I guess by magic) penetrate it and kill it Yaaay, pointed sticks! The dinos aren't completely invulnerable to gunfire - they manage to put out an eye of the second one with a pistol This runs it off, so it's NOT as mean as a bear or a buffalo, at least in the moviesThey kill the second dinosaur with a bomb - made from a gourd filled with gunpowder and gemstones My money would still be on the cannon It's engineered function is to concentrate all the gunpowder's energy in one direction - toward the target A bomb is a much more diffused application of force A _real_ bomb (NOT a gourd bomb) has a steel casing which contains the explosion to extremely high pressure (Think: pipe bomb vs firecracker) A pile of gunpowder set on fire will simply go POOF (Trust me on that one)\n",

            "Like several other reviewers here, I'm surprised to see many negative reviews on this film Dan O'Bannon's previous effort was the groundbreaking 'Alien' of 1979 Because it and 'Star Wars' introduced the stylistic approach of 'Used' or 'Dirty Space' in art-direction for these kinds of features doesn't mean that this was the only way to produce themRather than dismiss 'Lifeforce' out-of-hand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature, it's important to recognize that the film draws upon the 'esteemed' traditions of British horror and science-fiction - specifically Hammer and American International features like Quatermass (specifically 'Quatermass and the Pit', 1967), Doctor Who and 'The Day of the Triffids' (1963), if not the works of Gerry Anderson ('UFO', 'Space:1999' and 'Thunderbirds') But none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer O'Bannon's genre-scholarly appreciation for 'Queen of Blood'(1966) and 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space'(1958) - the immediate sources for 'Alien' (1979)Granted this film has some 'legacy' elements, but perhaps it's worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers - 1981's 'An American Werewolf in London' and 'The Company of Wolves' (1984) - other 80's films that share a 'looking-back' while they adapt those stories to the 80's zeitgeist All three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same, but substantially sexed-up their themes (because they could), and, at the same time they recognized the tongue-in-cheek, humorous aspects of their projectsNeil Jordan's 'Wolves' played to many of the psychoanalytic memes floating around at the during the '80's, while 'American Werewolf' curdled its theme as a 'coming-of-age' film It's called artistic license, and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latter-day dramedy inherent in the 'Scream' franchise, 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Final Destination' But these teen-targeted, films seem to be part of a box-office trend, whereas the 80's films like 'Lifeforce' belong a canon of British sci-fi - even if this one was written by an AmericanIn many ways this film holds up much better than latter-day disaster and alien-invasion flicks ('Independence Day', 'Armageddon', 'Deep Impact') in that the 'solutions' don't reside in gun-battles, weaponized payloads and testosterone At the opposite end of the pole, it is unfortunate that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron didn't examine Tarkowski and Lem more closely before they remade 'Solaris'The goal of this film was fun, not ponderousness or stupidity7/10\n",

            "My name is John Mourby and this is my story about Paperhouse: In May 2003 I saw Alfred Hitchcock's psycho, I was very scared and deeply disturbed I began a frantic search for a film that was frightening in the same way But none where satisfactory Amongst those tried and failed were The Birds, Night of the Living Dead, The Silence of the Lambs, The Blair Witch Project, Ring, The Evil Dead, The Sixth Sense, 28 Days Later, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, Near Dark, Alien, Peeping Tom, The Cell, Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now, Witchfinder General, Friday the 13th and The Omen That should confirm I was desperate! Long after I had stopped searching I found out about Paperhouse åÉåÉPaperhouse is based on a favourite book that I own, called Marianne Dreams Paperhouse had also come up in some of the books I had found on horror films, but they didn't tell me about the link between book and film I discovered the truth while on the Internet, I bought the film later that dayI thought Paperhouse would not be faithful to the book and dull Unfaithal it certainly was but dull certainly not It was the answer to my prayers Marianne is renamed Anna in the film but most of the original story is the same One day in school Anna draws a house in her scrap book (nothing remarkable about that) then she becomes ill and every time she faints or falls asleep she finds herself outside a creepy old house (and I mean genuinely unnerving) More she also finds that every time she puts something new in the drawing it appears in the dreamworld, EG an apple tree Anna draws into the dreamworld a rather sad boy named mark who apparently is a person in the real world Mark is a cripple but wants to leave the house, obligingly Anna draws in a lighthouse (a place to go to) but still the problem remains mark can't walk So Anna decides to draw her father in she gets her pencil out and gets too work, but the outcome is deformed and unsettling Anna particularly dislikes his eyes Quote \"he looks like madman\" So Anna tries to rub him out and start again, but the pencil proves indelible (that means nothing can be rubbed out) Then Anna loses her temper and crosses out her father's eyes! I leave you too find out for you self the terrible consequences of the rash actionPaperhouse truly is the British answer to A Nightmare on elm Street!

Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disasterAnother wonderful aspect about \"Dan in Real Life\" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the \"frat pack\" formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes \"Dan in Real Life\" is witty and has fun, intelligent laughs throughout Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from \"Dan in Real Life\" are more natural and clever, and involve some thinking on the part of the audienceMy only problem with \"Dan in Real Life\" is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson It's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director Either way, her character is unrealistic and annoying But, this is only a minor flaw in the film, and does not take away from the story as a wholeAll in all, \"Dan in Real Life\" is a great film, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies The quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is excellent It is simply a beautiful, light-hearted comedy\n",

            "Summary: Not worth the filmAs an avid Gone With the Wind fan, I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters Luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece When the book Scarlett came out, I read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together While the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as I was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable However, I consider the six hours I spent watching the \"Scarlett\" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life Discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in Margaret Mitchell's book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character In the novel, Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family After coming to an \"arrangement\" with Rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah Eventually, she accompanies her cousin Colum, a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood, to Ireland, to further explore her family's \"roots that go deep,\" and is eventually named \"The O'Hara,\" the head of the family While her duties as The O'Hara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara, Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties She, having been scorned by Rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry Luke, the earl of Fenton, until Rhett comes along in a clichÌ©d \"night-on-white-horse\" - type of a rescue The \"Scarlett\" miniseries fails even to do this justice Raped by her fiancÌ© and scorned by her family, the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committedI heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision\n",

            "A Scanner Darkly, Minority Report, Blade Runner, Sin City and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow åÐ if you are a fan of any of these then this will be well worth checking outFrench animation project 'Renaissance' took seven years to make on a shoestring budget and tonight I finally got to see it at a private screening for the International Film Festival in Stockholm My spontaneous reaction is awe; my further reflection is 'huh, neat' and closer analysis regrettably gets a resounding 'meh' It is a gorgeous science fiction triumph on the surface, but scratch it or even poke it a little and its unnecessarily complex plot becomes glaringly apparent, as do the flat characters Nevertheless it is clear that the people at Onyx films have done something spectacular with the aforementioned surface The visuals are staggering They have used live action motion capture fitted into key-frame animation, with stark jet black and bright white contrasts and a heavily shadowed rotoscoped background For those of you who are not down with the 'technical lingo', the film looks like a fully-animated Sin City Its fluid, transparent, dark and stylized template is complemented by great lurid lightning It's a vision Yet much credit is also due to the crisp sound effects that take the form of humming futuristic weapons, suspenseful music, heavy raindrops and glass shards breaking It's every tech-nerd's wet dreamThe film zooms in on an eerily-lit, bleak, futurescape Paris in which a major corporation called 'Avalon' has begun to interweave in the lives of the citizens with surveillance (think the fluid transparent screens from Minority Report) and genetic engineering The latter leads to a mysterious kidnapping of young researcher Ilona (voiced by the lovely Romola Garai) Cut to our hard-boiled cop-on-suspension and protagonist Karas (Daniel Craig) åÐ a man who takes the law into his own hands åÐ who is assigned the case of finding and retrieving Ilona During this case, he is being aided by Illona's sister with whom he also begins a love affair A very half-assed love affair, if I may say soThe world of Renaissance is remarkable Director Christian Volckman takes a fair jab at melting the noir themes and the result is an urban jungle filled with cads, rats, femme fatales and lonely detectives that hide in the shadows of the seedy slum The problem is that the creators undoubtedly felt the need to have extremely clear and spelled-out archetypes in the story, or the film would have been \"too surreal\" for mainstream audiences, owing to its lurid animation format It follows then that we have a multitude of clichÌ©d characters such as evil-laughing villains, sleazy crime bosses and butch tough-chicks who blow smoke every chance they get It shoves noir in our faces, and it isn't necessaryWhat is worse is that the dialogue is a little contrived It seems as though every line exists for the sole reason of propelling the plot This is nothing fatal because the plot is so complex once it gets going that it needs some clear direction Daniel Craig helps here too by bringing a no-nonsense attitude to his hard-edged cop character At one point in Renaissance, he is seen in a vivid car-chase that surely is one of the most adrenaline-pumping and top notch sequences of the film Unfortunately, the novelty of the sci-fi visuals have worn off post this car chase and 'Renassaince' could benefit from being slightly shorter In summary, a very interesting but flawed futuristic comic book experience7 out of 10\n",

            "I'm the sort of person who went down to the local library and read books on Babbage's difference engine whilst my schoolmates were playing football etc So, if there is any such thing as a target audience for this film, then I guess I'd probably be included in thatMaybe I just need to watch it again A previous reviewer mentioned not to watch this film whilst being tired Maybe that was my mistakeI tried my best to enjoy this film, and there are aspects of it that I do like, but overall I found it amateurish and quite ploddingBeing somewhat of a self confessed computer nerd, I just can't help but pick up on the exact time frame when the movie was actually made, and how the employed graphics reflect that time (ie 1997) Having played games of the era cf \"Mind Grind\" to cite one example, this film cannot escape that 16-bit colour low res multimedia explosion of that time Now thankfully this has somewhat lessened in more recent years in the gaming world at least, in favour of actual game playHaving to resort to watching this movie via a German FTA satellite channel (as I don't think it's ever been aired on UK FTA TV, well not recently anyway), I was mildly amused to see the end credits note Gottdog (God dog) had 4 people working on it's design Maybe it's mean spirited of me to be amused by this, given that ten years have elapsed since the movie was made, nevertheless the end result makes movie graphics from the eighties look good by comparisonBut, as for the main story, I agree that the format isn't the best idea Like others I agree that Ada deserves a film without the sci-fi angle, and a more straightforward biographical approach would perhaps be better suited to covering the life story of this remarkable ladyThere are fundamental mistakes that undermine my enjoyment of this movie First of all the underlying idea that somehow lost real-world information from the past can be accurately reconstructed through some sort of extrapolation via software based intelligent agents, seems somehow ludicrousAlso, the theme running through the movie that a computing device can indeed predict the mechanics of all things through the course of time (eg the winds) is now known not to be the caseOK, so the Victorians may have held this view, but the 20th century works of GÌ¦del proving that no mathematical system can be complete, Turing's works on the limits of computability, not to mention chaos theory and quantum mechanics, have all completely undermined these ideas, which seem central to how the modern day researcher's software is supposed to workFinally, the clicking of the mouse in the air to mean \"programming\" is also just plain wrong, as previously mentionedThis film maybe could have been OK, but at least some technical and scientific consultation would have given the film some much needed credit in the believability stakesI won't forget the film though, as like \"Pi\", it is clearly a unique work, but with too many fatal mistakes for me to truly enjoy it, 3/10 from me\n",

On the contrary actually, I never could have hoped Buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful regarding the portrayal of pure human misery The Thursday episode is a perfect example of this, as it stylishly shows different viewpoints of a famous German bridge while the names, ages and occupations of persons who jumped off appear on the screen The production values are inescapably poor and the editing often lacks professionalism, but this isn't what really counts in this type of cinema The subject matter is strong and forcing us to contemplate about the less cheerful åÐ but also indispensable åÐ aspects of life GREAT use of tragic music, too!\n",

            "I mention that there may be a spoiler here just to be cautious because of what I discuss, although I don't really think I am giving away anything important Any \"suprises\" are really unimportant to this film's success or a viewer's ability to enjoy it While not without some very minor flaws, this is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship, time, uncertainty, and the choices people make about their lives Yet, at the same time, it is also a very humorous film, with small, mostly understated bits of comedy woven in throughout For much of the film, it progresses at a fairly leisurely pace, but it does not seem slow at all since the film draws one into it and into the lives of the characters, and at first it is mostly rather light-hearted Some have commented that much of the film seems slow, but it is such a wonderful portrayal of the lives of such sympathetic characters that one could watch it almost endlessly As it progresses, the film becomes more emotional and moving up to the very end and the progression is handled wonderfully Eventually, some of the characters decide to rob a bank and although it is perhaps somewhat hard to believe, that is beside the point It is a wonderful addition to emphasise the love that these friends have for each other while at the same time it accents the humour and adds a little more irony to the film And, although hardly original to have a bunch of old guys rob a bank, the context and details are quite original and they do it wonderfully, making it really quite funny as well, such as when Ismet (if I remember correctly) exaggerates his aggressiveness to \"disguise\" the fact he's oldAs I said, most of the other comedy is rather low-key but still very humorous so I was constantly chuckling throughout The actors are probably the real key to this film They imbue the characters with deep personality and sympathy and portray them with great care and warmth There are some small transformations or tiny details of the characters' personalities which are pulled off smoothly and beautifully Of course, the film is about the personalities of these very characters and how they care for and interact with one another It succeeds so well because of them and if lesser actors had the roles the movie could well have failedGule Gule is not without sadness, but that simply provides the full range of emotions and provides a more powerful experience In fact, the film is so moving and filled with so much love from such rich characters that it is in the end a very heart-warming, satisfying, and even happy film despite its sadness I could watch it over and over\n",

            "I am a big fan of Ludlum's work, and of the Covert-one books, and I had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film Imagine my excitement, then, on learning that such a movie actually existed! The 'Hades Factor' being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to startFrom the outset the film was disappointing Simple elements from the film such as Griffin's first meeting with Smith are needlessly different from the book, and much less exhilarating Several characters are poorly cast, too For starters Dorff is woeful as Smith Not a bad actor, just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft, and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of John SmithRe-naming, re-assignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film For example the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire back-story of the virus, including the involvement of VAXHAM makes the entire point to the film somewhat hazy Marty Zellerbach is a very large part of the book, and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat (not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book) is another big mistakeRachel Russel is presumably supposed to be Randi Russel from the book Not only is she supposed to be the sister of Sophie Amsden (should be called Sophia Russel) but she is also supposed to work from the CIA, NOT \"Covert-one\" Which brings me to my final point, and I think one of the most important COVERT-ONE doesn't even exist at this point! Not until the second book of the series is Covert-One devised by the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorismTo be honest I could go on all day In short - if you like the books and want to see a good adaptation, I'm afraid you'll be bitterly disappointed Even as an action movie it is thoroughly average, mainly due to very lack-luster editing and poor effects The bumbled story line and dull-as-ditch-water script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film\n",

Poker table, novelty dart board, askew photos of baseball players, empty booze and beer containers, even a pair of Roman columns It's a place where men can be boys Simon and director Gene Saks do a great job opening up the stage play's single set, Oscar's living room, by moving the action into the bedrooms and kitchen and giving the mounting tension between Oscar and Felix more corners to bounce off ofNeal Hefti's familiar score was heard on the TV show, but never so sweepingly orchestrated as it is here, in several different arrangements that make the on-screen action soar whenever its played Real location work and night shots of Manhattan give the film an energy common to films shot in that place and time (\"Buddwing,\" \"The World Of Henry Orient,\" \"Midnight Cowboy,\" \"Manchurian Candidate,\" \"Rosemary's Baby,\" etc)Are Lemmon and Matthau too heavy in comparison to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman To be fair, the movie is meant to be a more serious affair, dealing with the then-uncommon condition of mid-life divorce and the frustration inherent in not being able to make a relationship work Simon has more in mind than entering Felix and Oscar in a game of \"Password\" or a battle of wits with Howard Cosell But I don't knowBoth Lemmon and Matthau were terrific comedians I enjoy watching especially in the middle of this film as I often do in their separate movies, but I never understood why they were regarded as a great comedy team Here, in their best-regarded partnership, they seem to be acting in two different films; Lemmon in a comedy-drama and Matthau in a farce Matthau is great in the beginning, charming us with his teddy-bear demeanor around the poker table, but near the end of the film he takes a turn much like Jack Torrance's in \"The Shining,\" reacting to Felix cleaning up his apartment and serving tasty food to his friends in a way that totally upsets the delicate balance of blameWhile the ending bothers me, the part many see as the most jarring, the beginning, works fine as I see it Watching Felix stumbling around trying to kill himself isn't great comedy, no, but it's a good way to get into a great comedy, setting us up with some real-life pain before bringing in the warmth and laughter (Plus it has some great shots of the seedier parts of the city) In the middle of the movie, this scene would have been a miscalculation, but it works as a way of establishing Felix's torment and a sense of sharp relief to come when we see Oscar and his poker friends bicker and feudThat's where Simon's lines are so great They are the underlying strength of the film He gets the banter exactly right and real, and still makes it funny \"I don't mind you talking, Felix You got things to say What's scaring me is I'm beginning to listen\" The TV show showed how wrong it is to assume the movie is always better, in fact the TV show once made a good point about \"assuming\" anything at all, but the movie makes for a solid foundation and is a joy in its own right\n",

            "I've rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on DVD without reading any reviews about it So, after 15 minutes of watching I've noticed that something is wrong with this movie; it's TERRIBLE! I mean, in the trailers it looked scary and serious!I think that Eli Roth (Mr Director) thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid, the movie would be funny(So stupid, it's funny WRONG!) He should watch and learn from better horror-comedies such as:\"Fright Night\", \"The Lost Boys\" and \"The Return Of the Living Dead\"! Those are funny!\"Cabin Fever\" is THE reason why I registered to wwwIMDbcom so I can release my thoughts of discontent about itI've decided to watch the movie a second time AAARGH!How bad can a script and a director be This bad Here are the awful scenes in chronological order:In the early scenes we see Henry, who doesn't realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead-glazed stare is dead!The movie doesn't explain anything about the blonde long-haired kid who like to bite peopleAnd my answer to Marcy's unanswered question (\"What's wrong with the woods\") is \"nothing\" The script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for \"suspense\"Then the \"smartest\" of the 5-pack, Bert, almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire He meets now-infected Henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the \"F-word\" Bert starts to freak out because Henry looks awfully ill Bert:\"Don't make me shoot you!\" (he forgets to add: \"with my BB gun!\")Bert heads back to the cabin but how about that He meets Marcy and Jeff who were having sex, but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk! Marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire Bert had started earlier (A moment of clarity for a change) Bert doesn't mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his BB gunLater, as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire, another weirdo shows up with his dog (Maybe that's what the warning about the woods is all about It's filled with weirdosand their dogs!) They let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis (Their brains are completely intoxicated! No wonder why they are all so DUMB!) This is the last time we'll see this forgettable characteralive!Henry shows up at their cabin, (NOTE: He was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin!!!) looking worse, almost like a zombie, covered in goo! He says he needs a doctor But the Young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker He gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition Henry almost seems smart enough to drive the Hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard, seats and windows The Fantastic Five come out running, armed with: a BB Gun, a knife, a baseball bat (huh Ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods), a poker, and a (insecticide) spray-can, ready to combat the single, unarmed and terribly sick man (clever script!) Bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his BB Gun, which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth \"What else am I supposed to do\" Bert yells in his defense Jeff and Paul try to knock Henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck's windows instead Henry walks up to the dumb girls who say: \"He's coming towards us!\" (Thanks for the info, dumb broads, I can see that! But I don't think he wants to do you any harm!) Marcy sprays in his eyes, making Henry yelp! And our \"hero\" Paul touches Henry's arm with a burning log from the campfire, which they recklessly left burning while they were INSIDE the cabin! (Where has all that wisdom gone I guess the cannabis had started to take its toll!:-) Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away, screamingThe following day, Bert and Jeff head out for a mechanic And Marcy decides to \"go for help\" all by herself, in the woods, as Paul stays behind with KarenDoesn't that sound idiotic Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already \"going for help\"!I skip my comments now to how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE rowing over a huge and winding river! How did she get a canoe Does she even know where she's going! Anyway, she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and, like in most horror movies, walks inside the cabin saying:\"Hello Is anyone there\" Bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her (and me at first) And along comes Jeff, as well How did THEY get here! Did they swim across the river Do you see how brainless the script is!Deputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin He somehow doesn't notice the blood on their truck This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the DVD out (Before I take my own eyes out!Now, THAT's funny!)If you liked this movie, do yourself a favor and watch \"Fright Night\", \"The Lost Boys\", or \"The Return of The Living Dead\" Then you'll see they are MORE entertaining than thisthing Even the \"Toxic Avenger part 2\", which is also a lousy film, is way MORE funnier than \"Cabin Fever\"\n",

Jim quickly realises that the brain is controlling the entire town and he alone must stop the brain, before it takes over the world!Directed by Ed Hunt who calls himself Edward Hunt here, the Brain wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be Don't get me wrong as it certainly isn't great either The script by Barry Pearson tries a stab at satire with the brain washing and mind control by TV storyline It moves along at a fair pace and isn't too boring No explanation is given for the existence of the brain at all, it's just there and that's it we have to accept it The story is a little choppy and never fully explores one single element, there's the TV mind control, the brain itself, Jim being hunted by the police & his misbehaviour and various other little bits and pieces here and there including a bizarre revelation regarding Dr Blake that isn't explained at all Production wise this film looks cheap, and probably was cheap The acting isn't great but I've seen worse, and what is David Gale doing in this In fact this role is similar to Gale's role in Re-Animator (1985) even down to his character's deaths in both films The brain itself at first sits in a tank and starts to grow whenever it eats someone and by the end it is pretty big Each stage is just made of rubber It doesn't look particularly good and isn't scary or creepy, just cheap There's no blood or gore in it apart from a blink and you'll miss it decapitation The nudity is provided by Dr Blake's assistant Vivian (Christine Kossak as Christine Kossack) before she gets eaten The brain had a certain entertainment value for me but I would think most people would dislike it Maybe worth a watch if you can see it on TV for free\n",

            "The beautiful, charming, supremely versatile and talented Irene Dunne is one of the greatest 5 or 6 actresses of American cinema In Over 21 - as in all her films - she lights up the screen with a natural, yet glamorous presence She is simultaneously authentic and human, AND a charismatic, inspirational model This role is quintessential Irene Dunne, full of pathos and wit and a little mischief I love all of her films, and this film was a fantastic new discovery for me when TCM aired it last night I hope they don't wait years to air it againLikewise, Charles Coburn is one of the greatest character actors in all of American filmdom True, he often portrays variations on the same theme, but I never tire of watching his soft-hearted curmudgeons Here his character is the perfect foil for Irene Dunne, and he is portrayed perfectly by Coburn Their conflicts in this film are absolutely fantastic They never miss a beat In addition, they represent the central conflict of the film and the moral conflict of Irene Dunne's husband, portrayed by Alexander KnoxI am not as familiar with Knox's work He was recognizable, but that was about all However, cast with Dunne and Coburn, he holds his own He delivers a fine, nuanced performance His character has noble motives that are made accessible to us by Knox's performance and never held over us like some holy grail He is noble, but conflicted and doubts his ability to successfully complete OCS His interaction with Dunne, is always convincing, too Dunne supports him without being syrupy or becoming a martyr, and he responds in kind Their scenes are very well doneThe film, itself, is a fantastic snapshot of a moment and a milieu not portrayed in other movies I don't recall off the top of my head another movie that portrays America still fighting WWII, but with the end in sight and the focus on the establishment of the post-war world Not the usual WWII movie! That in itself is interesting; it is also essential to the plot and the movie's message In contrast to other commentators, I thought that the climactic speech was okay, but not great It was delivered very well by Knox, but it was not as \"tightly\" written as the build-up led me to expect I have heard better cinematic speeches addressing very similar themes It served its purposeFor me, the greater value of the movie, was the depiction of the life of Dunne and Knox, as it reflected the typical OCS experience The sense of community among the wives living on Palmetto Terrace seemed absolutely authentic - as did Palmetto Terrace, itself, despite the fact that it was obviously a sound stage set The incredibly brief encounters between the wives and their OCS husbands The rigors of the OCS candidates, mastering the difficult and complex material they had to learn The shabby \"base housing\" - obviously hastily constructed The tired and worn furnishings The constant and harrowingly short deadlines - for returning to base, for learning lessons, for catching trains to subsequent \"posts\" Tenants constantly running into their predecessors and successors in the base housing, as they were moving in and out Yes, I suspect this was a glimpse of a real WWII experience - clothed in some comedy, but very real at its core I loved it, and I recommend it highly\n",

Further, Radu Muntean's directing is skilled and expressive, creating in a very compelling style that feeling of \"a fateful night\" and inescapable destiny One can easily pass over the few awkward and even failed moments, since time proved them to be only the uncertainties inherent to a debut, never repeated in his subsequent movies: \"HÌ¢rtia va fi albastrÌ\" and \"Boogie\"\n",

            "\"The Beguiled\" is a strange work among Clint Eastwood's oeuvre By 1971 he had become well known as the star of action movies, not only Westerns (the genre in which he first made his name) but also war films (such as \"Where Eagles Dare\") and cop thrillers (such as \"Coogan's Bluff\") Yet although \"The Beguiled\" takes place during wartime (the American Civil War), and was made by Don Siegel who had earlier directed Eastwood in \"Coogan's Bluff\" and was later the same year to direct him in \"Dirty Harry\", it is not an action film in the traditional sense In most of his previous films Eastwood had played an active role, but here his role is largely passive- his character, Sergeant John McBurney, is a wounded fugitive forced to rely upon the charity of women in order to survive Even while serving with his unit, McBurney played no active part in the conflict; he is a Quaker, whose religious principles forbid him to bear arms, and was serving with the Union forces as a medical orderly The film is set in Louisiana towards the end of the war and starts with the injured McBurney being discovered by a young girl named Amy and brought back to her boarding school The school is a small one, with only two teachers and a handful of girls Although some of the girls are ardent supporters of the Confederate cause and want to hand him over to the authorities, the headmistress, Martha Farnsworth, decides to shelter him and tend him, fearing that his injuries are likely to prove fatal should he be sent to one of the Confederacy's notoriously harsh prison camps Although McBurney scrupulously follows the teachings of his religion as regards pacifism, he is not so scrupulous when it comes to following its teachings on the sin of fornication, and as he starts to recover he makes full use of his opportunity to exercise his charms on both the staff and the older girls, and he wins the affections of number of them, including Miss Farnsworth, her assistant Edwina and Carol, one of the older girls Even twelve year old Amy appears to have a sort of childish crush on him In the sexually repressed atmosphere of the all-female school his presence gives rise to jealousy and hatred, and Miss Farnsworth, rejected in favour of the sluttish Carol, plots a terrible revenge (Interestingly, the one female to resist McBurney's blandishments is Hallie, Miss Farnsworth's black slave, even though he tries to win her round by pointing out that he is fighting to free people like her) \"The Beguiled\" has been described as an anti-war film, but this seems to me to be a misconception The film is not really about the rights and wrongs of the Civil War or of war in general The only acts of violence we see are perpetrated by non-combatants, and they are motivated by a desire for personal revenge, not by zeal for the Confederate cause It would be more accurate to see the film as a drama about the psychological stresses that can be caused by the peculiar circumstances of war At the beginning the school, set in a beautiful old antebellum mansion, seems like an island of peace amid the war The building is in the Classical style, associated with order, harmony and restraint, but the story that unfolds within its walls is one of disorder, passion and violence, qualities associated with the Gothic school of writing which in the 19th century was often regarded as the antithesis of Classicism The film can be seen as falling within what has been called the \"Southern Gothic\" tradition in American film and literature The film was not a great hit at the box office, possibly because Eastwood was cast so much against type It is not perhaps his best film, but it did show that he could expand his range and play something other than action heroes (In \"Play Misty for Me\", his first film as director made the following year, he was again to play a \"passive\" character in danger from a vindictive female) There are some very good performances from the female members of the cast, particularly Geraldine Page as Martha Farnsworth, outwardly a respectable middle-aged spinster but inwardly a woman of strong passions (There are hints that she may have been having an affair with a man whom she passed off as her brother) There are also good contributions from Elizabeth Hartman as the shy, repressed Edwina, who falls in love with McBurney and rejects the idea of revenge and from young Pamelyn Ferdin as Amy (Amy is an animal lover- a key moment in the film comes when McBurney kills her pet turtle- so it is interesting that in later life Ferdin became an animal rights activist) The one character I was less keen on was Jo Ann Harris's Carol who seemed too modern, like a swinging seventies chick transported back in time to the 1860s The film is notable for the emotionally intense \"hothouse\" atmosphere which Siegel brings to it This will not be a film which is to everyone's taste; some will find it too overwrought and melodramatic, and some have found it misogynistic (Judith Crist called it a film for \"woman haters and sadists\") Others, however, may find it a compelling psychological drama 7/10\n",

            "In August Days/Dies d'agost Marc Recha has given us a sun-saturated Catalan documentary-style road movie that's mostly a meandering improvised meditation on brotherhood and reclaiming the dead The beautiful sometimes large-scale, richly atmospheric 35 mm landscape images, nice soundtrack and Catalan-language narration are enchanting as a mood piece, if one is content with a trajectory that hasn't much momentum and doesn't lead anywhere in particular Filmmaker Marc Recha and his non-identical twin David are the stars and the narrative is voiced by their younger sister Marc had been researching the life of Ramon Barnils (1940-2001), a socialist editor who had been a family friend He felt he was saturated with information and had to take a break The break turned into making this film, which seeks to capture the mood of the interviews with Barnils' associates, thoughts about the Spanish Civil War, the drought season they were experiencing, the rugged landscape, the Recha brothers' affection for each other, swims and suntanned nudity and whatever characters or stories they ran into as they camped out of their van This leads to pursuit of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers In the end David has to go back to Barcelona to be with his daughter and Marc has to return to his project, and there it ends I found it fascinating to listen to an extended narration in the Catalan language with its blend of Spanish and French-sounding words (perhaps linked with ProvenÌ¤al) This isn't a major film but it commands attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clean visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing around with genres and blending autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh and thought-provoking wayAn official selection of the 2006 New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center\n",
            "A CRY IN THE DARK A CRY IN THE DARK was a film that I anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid, if unremarkable film This assumption came from the fact that aside from Streep's Best Actress nomination, the movie received little attention from major awards groupsLittle did I anticipate that A CRY IN THE DARK would be such a riveting drama, well-constructed on every level If you ask me, this is an under-appreciatted classicThe film opens rather slowly, letting the audience settle into the Chamberlain's at a relaxed pace and really notice that, at the core, they are an incredibly loving, simple family Fred Schepisi (the director) selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy, while also showing the attentive bliss with which Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain care for their childrenWhile the famous line \"A Dingo Took My Baby!\" has become somewhat of a punchline these days, the movie never even comes close to laughable The actual death of Azaria is horrifyingly captured It is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience horrified and asking questionsThe majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the Chamberlain's continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court, which suspects Lindy of murderThe fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping As an audience member, I was fully invested in the Chamberlain's plight and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media But at the same, the media/public opinion is understandable I loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic, but they always had valid reasons to hold their viewsThe final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramasIn terms of performances, the only ones that really matter in this film are those of Streep and Neill and they deliver in every way For me, this ranks as one of (if not #1) Meryl Streep's best performances For all her mastery of different accents (which of course are very impressive in their own right), Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters I find this to be one of Streep's more subtle performances, and she hits it out of the park And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streep's performance From what I've seen, this is undoubtedly Neill's finest work to date It's a shame he wasn't recognized by the Academy with a Leading Actor nomination to match Streep's b/c the two of them play of each other brilliantlyMore emotionally gripping than most films, and also incredibly suspenseful A CRY IN THE DARK far exceeded my expectations I highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where Meryl screams \"The dingo took my baby!\" watch the film and see just how much more there is to A CRY IN THE DARK then that one line A \n",

Mobile suits based on angels - Check!OK - its a Gundam series This one, Gundam Wing, has good character development, real-world complexity, interesting ideas and some pretty eye-candyWith characters, the initially weak Relena Dorlan (later Peacecraft, then back to Dorlan) gets stronger and more independent (although is still absolutely besotted with Heero Yuy, the series main character) The aforementioned Heero, initially a cold, hard butcherer, becomes more and more human, while still remaining in-character And seeing the lost Millardo Peacecraft (whos nomm de guerre is Zechs Marquise) float between OZ, freelance, and command of White Fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creationsThe complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good - reflecting how the real world works However, in 49 half-hour episodes, it does become a bit of a liability in that this complexity isn't used to its full potentialThe ideas at the core of the series - the necessity of fighting, the desire for peace, etc - are ones that resonate even today In retrospect, the series was ahead of its time, what with the \"War on Terrorism\" and all But its exploration of these ideas, the monologues, especially those of Treize Kushrenada, is an incredible dramatic piece, forming some of the best writing in the seriesBut that sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor, which dramatically causes it to lose some of its edgeIn terms of eye-candy, which is what this one has in bucketloads, everything from the mobile suits to the battleship Libra (No not the tampons you idiot!) is wells designed, and explodes in big balls of orange (which is bad, because better animation would've had better explosions) But who cares! Stuff explodes, and thats all that mattersIn short though, the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes, you've missed out on a lot The poor writing can leave you cringing, and sometimes the animation makes you go \"WTF!!\" But this is made up for in its classic animation style, its scale, sparks of incredible dialogue, and its more mature exploration that one expects of such Japenese animations\n",

The reason why I don't want him dead is because i'm afraid of him, and I know that if I kill him his son and wife will kill me, that's why he doesn't die!\" Of course the fact that it's wrong to kill someone, let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation OddHowever don't let me make this sound that I hated this movie, far from it, it's so terrible it's priceless The biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees Grunner going one on one with gang-members who (the film's biggest logic gap)decline the use of pistols Also a handicapped Vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs, while Gruner kick-boxes the rest All of this set to the sound of horrible \"Mexican\" accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as thisThe other treat about this movie, is that for some reason Olivier Gruner never attends college despite that's the main reason he's here in the states and not in France getting it on with his girlfriend (In a graveyard in the film's awkward beginning) Angel Town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level, this is the perfect movie for you On the other hand make sure to down tequila, like the laughable opening song details \"Ain't no mercy in Angel Town\"  out of 4-(Bad)\n",

            "Audiences today will probably watch a film like Ossessione and not really consider how unprecedented it was during the time when it came out The structure of the film really divorces from sap-happy Hollywood conventionsåÑas well as other major theatrical elements It relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light Films of this natureåÑthe neo-realist filmsåÑwere made to reflect the darkness felt during post-World War II times Ossessione tackles some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war, including: adultery, conspiracy, murder, pregnancy, etc Aside from the one crane shot and certain musical swelling moments, the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty: shot on-location, uses natural lighting and most likely non-popular actors All of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film, yielding the following theme: Negative karmic repercussions will haunt those who deliberately act immorallyThe two leadsåÑGino and GiovannaåÑare polar opposites, yet both carry the mentality: we're bored and we want to be entertained Gino is a drifter; a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations Giovanna is a bored house-wife cemented in the familiarly of marital permanence: she doesn't want to leave her home and husband, but would rather remain where she is because it's safer Gino's lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle Giovanna craves; the only difference is that she's too afraid to live it herselfåÑthat's why she falls in love with Gino: he represents everything she wants but doesn't have the courage to get She wants to live in a world free from the monotony of living with her corpulent husbandåÑGino is the perfect ticket into that world The affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the 40's feeling somewhat uneasy I mean, films prior to the neo-realist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before To say the least it was probably a bit alarmingIn conjunction with the theme, the neo-realist style helps show the negative repercussions of adulterous behavior Succinctly put, adulterous behavior (as shown in the film) leads to depressing and ultimately deadened lives When Gino and Giovanna conspire with each other to \"eliminate\" Giovanna's husband, karma comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done They return to their home: the atmosphere is dark and biting (as can be expected from the neo-realist style) They are not happy; they're actually more depressed They thought that by eliminating Giovanna's husband that they'd live happier lives, but they were duped The film ends with Giovanna's deathåÑit being in karmic similitude of her husband's death I think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons Here's whyThere's a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen, and if so, to what extent I think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being glorified, but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have As the subtext of Ossessione asks, is adultery and murder evil I think the film eagerly responds yes! The adulterous behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are Ironically though, towards the end of the film when they seem to be healed of their depression and are seen basking in each other's arms inside the car, the author of the film shows that their happiness is, in fact, a faÌ¤ade: the car crashes off the cliff and into the river, killing Giovanna; the police arrest Gino I think it was the author's intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior, in the end karma will come back to haunt them I agree I think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly selfishåÑalways wanting instant gratification and not willing to endure through hard times This was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that Gino and Giovanna experience in their relationship: he can't handle the pressure of living in Giovanna's husband shadow, so he leaves Giovanna and sleeps with another girl Such is typical of the insatiable, hedonistic personalityAll in all, the film seemed very risky for its time The audience, however, was prepared to see such a film because of the sobriety the war brought Those pre-war, happy-go-lucky films were no longer being believed Movie-going audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters: they wanted to see characters whose lives were entangled in so-called 'sin' because it was a reflection of their own life problems Ossessione, then, acts as a great catalyst for where the future of film was heading That is, a lot of the naturalism pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neo-realist film movement\n",

Well, there kind of is in fact, relative to your average 60s topless volleyball number anyway And the enervating patina of 'class' at least delivers clean, detailed compositions But what the hell kind of thing is that to say about a porn OK then: the only scene I really (rhetorically) got off on was the first time Brigitte Maier steps in There are efforts to toss in a nice variety of race and age while letting no two men anywhere near each other; the one black guy suffers a premature bout of editorial coitus interruptus And multiple takes or not, one perhaps undescribable-on-IMDb act does look like it was partially simulated by a surgical hose Still, I stayed awake, and it was eight in the morningbut what does the last shot mean!\n",

Atomic-age fantasy is rather charming in a very cheesy way Perhaps it was considered a thoughtful sci-fi in its time (with psychological overtones), yet seen today the film is mildly overbaked and naive; it's a camp-fest tailor-made for TV's late-late show Wooden performances by Lansing and Lee Meriwether barely rate as one-dimensional, though Patty Duke (playing a cute brat pre-\"Miracle Worker\") gets a colorful, memorable exit  from \n",

            " I suppose this is not the best film ever made but I voted it at 10 stars all the same Mainly because of my feelings at the end I and all the people around me were simply touched This is something you don't often feel  We are all getting a bit cynical and fed up with over sentimentality, lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films The story of the film centres around Jane a young woman in the last stages of MND and the friendship that grows between her and Richard, a man on the verge of a breakdown This could have so easily been a dull and worthy piece but it is so humorous, humane and lacking in sentimentality that it wins you over completely and against the odds is a feel good movie The acting from Branagh and Bonham-Carter is superb especially the latter who is always believable and strong in her role The chemistry between the two also lifts the movie The title comes from Richards masterpiece, a plane made of junk and his old paintings Flying here is a symbol for both Richards and Janes living life to the full so that one can carry on and the other can face the end A beautiful and funny movie that I would recommend to anyone don't let the subject matter put you off\n",

            "This is a surprisingly great low budget Horror/Comedy, it's funny and pretty well made, with good performances and a really cool twist ending! All the characters are pretty cool, and the story while unoriginal is very good, plus Eric Jungmann(Adam) and Justin Urich(Harley) had fantastic chemistry together One of the funniest moments in the film for me is when Adam is trapped in the bathroom, and Harley wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there, and decides to take a pss in the truck, and Aimee Brooks is just plain sexy!, plus this is one of the best low budget Horror films I have seen in a long time It's very gory, but in a comical way, and I thought it was very well written as well, plus Michael Bailey Smith is fantastic as the Monster Man and had some wicked makeup! It's similar to films like Joy Ride, Duel, Jeepers Creepers, etc, etc and it has some suspenseful moments here and there, plus The gore effects are really well done for the most part This is a surprisingly great low budget Horror/Comedy, it's funny and pretty well made, with good performances and a really cool twist ending, I highly recommend this one! The Direction is very good! Michael Davis does a very good! job here, with great camera work, good angles,good use of colors, and using a great setting, plus he kept the film funny and at a very fast paceThere is a lot of gore! We get extremely bloody nose bleeds,gory impaling's, bloody stabbings,guy is cut in half by a monster truck, human remains in a cooked stew, guts all over the place,guys guts fall out,pencil in the eyes,bloody slit throat,bunch of people walking around without limbs,gory dead squirrel,heads are squished,severed limbs,bloody and mangled corpses,decent amount of bloodshed,one very gory scene at the very end and more!The Acting is very good for a low budget film Eric Jungmann is fantastic here as Adam, he was a nerd but a very likable one, he had fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich, had some cool lines,and I just loved his character, he also seemed to be enjoying himself,and he was especially good at the end! Justin Urich is excellent as the ass of a Best Friend, however I just couldn't help but love him as he was very funny, and often stole a lot of the scenes, I really dug him! Aimee Brooks is gorgeous, and did great with what she had to do, she had good chemistry with Jungmann and like Jungmann was especially good at the end, as I loved her mysterious character Michael Bailey Smith is wonderful as The Monster Man he was very creepy looking, had some awesome makeup, and is now one of my favorite slashers! Rest of the cast do fineOverall I highly recommend this one! 1/2 out of 5\n",
            "The 1930' were a golden age of Los Angeles with its film industry and great potential of various other possibilities to become rich and famous and happy People were arriving there hoping to fulfill their dreams Expecting open arms and welcoming offers there were only a few who managed to succeed and find their way to stardom, majority then condemned to live starving, disillusioned and unwanted, searching for a bit of respect in dirty bars and nasty hotel rooms Young Italian-American writer Arturo Bandini arrives to LA on a similar quest - to spread his charms around to get one of those beautiful wealthy women and to write an excellent novel that would set him on a career path, having so far written a single short story published in an obscure anthology Wishing to create a romantic masterpiece he seems to be unable to produce anything without experiencing it himself though, occasionally, he sends pieces of magazine stories to a local editor that helps him survive He is proud to present himself as an Italian but deep in his heart he truly feels his Italian origin as a burden The little money and the courage to conquer the world he once had are all long gone and watching his dream turning into a hangover he holds a last single nickel to spend The coffee she brought him was cold and sour and spitting a curse on her triggers a never-ending relationship of insults, unspoken excuses and a love concealed beneath Camilla being an uneducated girl trying to receive US citizenship through a marriage also carries her heavy cross of a non-perspective racial heritage Though she is much of a stronger and life experienced person her situation as a beautiful Mexican woman is much harder to deal with than Arturo is able to realize Is it obvious that Arturo eventually finds his inspiration to work on the novel Is it possible that their love finally finds its place in the sun Is it likely that their romance takes an unlucky turnIt is very surprising to find out that the chemistry between the two main characters, performed by Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, does not work The relationship lacks the raw and authentic feelings Hayek though livelier a character compared to Farrell's forgot to arm Camilla with the passion and strength of her once brilliant character Frida Also it is hard to have faith in a character which being intelligent but uneducated and illiterate uses quite difficult vocabulary and complicated sentences A tougher character of a Phil Marlowe sort would definitely suit Farrell better, though he looks stunning in a period costume, he seems very lost trying to find the fragile world of a twenty-year old dreamer balancing between a hidden love and desire to be true to himself Feeling embarrassed watching the two on the screen is not right Their relationship might have been wild but it is more likely what a thunder and a lightning are without a storm, far from real passion, feelings just described not felt inside It is very sad that such a potential of an interesting script and good actors was wasted, turned into a grey average of soon-to-be-forgotten\n",

            "This review may contain some SPOILERSJust when you thought they didn't make them so extremely bad anymore, along comes Rae Dawn Chong as a space vixen and Willie Nelson as a Native American witchdoctor! It's even worse when you factor in that these two are the BETTER aspects of `Starlight,' a film that should only be viewed for laughsChong is an alien sent to Earth to seek out the only remaining half-breed, part man and part alien Apparently, the Earth is in dire straits Something is wrong with the genetics of mankind, and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland Only by duplicating the DNA of the half-breed can the kindly alien race save the planet Don't ask me how that is, since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution, which is caused by humans You would think Earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures, not saving them! Anyway, the half-breed turns out to be Billy Wirth, a man living in a small Southwestern town and is part Native American from his mother's line, despite the fact that his mother is a red-headed Caucasian and his grandfather is Willie Nelson Wasn't this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic Carmen Electra bomb `The Chosen One' such a howler Chong arrives in her ship just as Wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend Before you can say utter the word `hogwash,' Chong is revealing her secret to Wirth, who isn't surprised for a moment, and spreading the word to Wirth's family Chong also makes pals with Wirth's mother, who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years Well, this is because Wirth's father was an alien that abandoned her Of course, he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to Earth for Wirth so he can use Wirth's DNA to make the people of Earth his slaves (Huh) His laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture Wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie Not only are they boring, but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the mostThe ideas might be nice on paper, but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity, particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien But the effects are the bane of the movie The opening scene involves Chong on her spaceship, communicating with her superior, someone who we do not see but that Chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light They use no spoken words, but telepathy, so we are treated to subtitles Trouble is, both Chong and her superior's subtitles both look alike, and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually `speaking' at any given moment, which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish The spaceship is the worst effect to come out of Hollywood this side of an Ed Wood film Now, I am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this, but these effects really got to me The most offensive was the most simple one: a fake night sky The stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone Most notably are the moments where Chong tells someone she comes from Pleiades, and we get a shot of the seven stars Thing is, the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie, but any stargazer knows that Pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations Perseus and Taurus, and the cluster doesn't take up much room in the sky at all These effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment Be careful, for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have Willie Nelson turn into a human spotlight and    Oh, it has to be seen to be believed!Starlight, star bright; Last star I see tonight; I wish I might, I wish I may; not have to watch any more of this trash todayZantara's score: 1 out of 10\n",

In fact I may try that one myself next weekend The last minute addition of genre veteran (and personal favourite) Brad Dourif, instead of enriching the film like it should, almost seems to hand Dourif the movie in a last ditch effort to stop Vosloo from hamming, but quite frankly Dourif looks deeply uncomfortable (possibly waiting for the next assault of bad acting) next to Vosloo, and even an eccentric turn from him fails to resuscitate the filmIf the acting was better, this movie would have been okay Hell, it might have been pretty enjoyable, but the lack of character makes the movie a soulless affair, and makes the horror element seem tacked on and tasteless instead of an organic part of the film I found the alien torture/rape scenes a little difficult to stomach already, but the fact that the characters were so lacking made them seem gratuitous as well as unpleasant, leaving a nasty taste in the mouthSo, if you really like Sci-fi and don't have a problem with bad acting, pedestrian pacing and a really garish, nasty rape scene, Progeny will probably be your cup of tea But since I do, I'm probably never going to watch it again Once was enough On the plus side, this is the only Sci-Fi movie Yuzna ever bothered to make, so he obviously wasn't really that pleased with it himself\n",
            "From the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful 'Cruel Intentions', and how flat it landed You'll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting Robin Dunne as Valmont Then in the second scene, you meet the two best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother That is, if you can get past the fact that Kathryn wasn't blonde in the first film Then the movie goes on, you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago, and you notice Sebastian has already met an Anette in the past, here called Danielle, and a Cecile, here called Cherie How original is that for a prequel Then it turns into a low budget 'Wild Things' type of film with lots and lots of oh-my \"twists\" As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice Not that he is a bad actor, he's good He just doesn't have the charisma Ryan did Amy Adams, who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time, once again delivers But with all the talent in the world, there is no way one could save this trash As a whole, this \"movie\" feels like a 'Beverly Hills, 90210' episode The score has been stolen from 'Cruel Intentions' and 'Jawbreaker' Yes, they used the score from JAWBREAKER Couldn't they at least leave that one alone! You'll want to pass this one If you want more Cruel Intentions, watch Stephen Frears' Dangerous Liaisons\n",

            "A plane carrying employees of a large biotech firm--including the CEO's daughter--goes down in thick forest in the Pacific Northwest When the search and rescue mission is called off, the CEO, Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission But just what is Knowles searching for and trying to rescue, and just what is following and watching them in the woods Oy, what a mess this film was! It was a shame, because for one, it stars Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favorite modern genre actors, and two, it could have easily been a decent film It suffers from two major flaws, and they're probably both writer/director Jonas Quastel's fault--this film (which I'll be calling by its aka of Sasquatch) has just about the worst editing I've ever seen next to Alone in the Dark (2005), and Quastel's constant advice for the cast appears to have been, \"Okay, let's try that again, but this time I want everyone to talk on top of each other, improvise non-sequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possible\"The potential was there Despite the rip-off aspects (any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib The Blair Witch Project (1999) and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing Predator (1987)), Ed Wood-like exposition and ridiculous dialogue, the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts The monster costume, once we actually get to see it, was more than sufficient for my tastes The mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if Quastel and fellow writer Chris Lanning would have turned down the stereotype notch from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships The monster's \"lair\" had some nice production design, specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001) If it had been edited well, there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effectiveBut the most frightening thing about Sasquatch is the number of missteps made: For some reason, Quastel thinks it's a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene A, then a few lines of scene B, then back to A, back to B, and so onFor some reason, he thinks it's a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue, whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anywayFor some reason, he doesn't care whether scenes were shot during the morning, afternoon, middle of the night, etc He just cuts to them at random For that matter, the scenes we're shown appear to be selected at random Important events either never or barely appear, and we're stuck with far too many pointless scenesFor some reason, he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there, or it needs to just be cut out, because it's not that important (the monster's intelligence and \"humanity\" could have easily been shown in another way)For some reason, there is a whole character--Mary Mancini--left in the script even though she's superfluousFor some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft-core porno scene, even though the motif is never repeated againFor some reason, characters keep calling Harlan Knowles \"Mr H\", like they're stereotypes of Asian domesticsFor some reason, Quastel insists on using the \"Blurry Cam\" and \"Distorto-Cam\" for the monster attack scenes, even though the costume doesn't look that bad, and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog, a subtle filter, or anything else other than bad cinematographyI could go on, but you get the ideaI really wanted to like this film better than I didåÑI'm a Henriksen fan, I'm intrigued by the subject, I loved the setting, I love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one level--but I just couldn't Every time I thought it was \"going to be better from this point until the end\", Quastel made some other awful move In the end, my score was a 3 out of 10\n",

            "I used to watch this on either HBO or Showtime or Cinemax during the one summer in the mid 90's that my parents subscribed to those channels I came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark, bizarre and fascinating I was young then, in my early teens; and now years later after having discovered the great Arliss Howard and being blown away by \"Big Bad Love\" I bought the DVD of \"Wilder Napalm\" and re-watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years I absolutely loved it!

            "Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands, trying to make sense of what he's just done Meanwhile, a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agency's response to what's just happened on screen An American flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot, but as he speaks, it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory, as if it doesn't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national securityThis shot effectively captures the mood of the film As well as portraying Bourne's quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and securityIt is also probably the best film you'll see in the cinema this year It's just so intense Bourne says to Simon Ross (Considine) \"This isn't some newspaper story, this is real\" and in the audience you almost believe him The camera shakes, but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying, instead of just being actors performing well-written roles The action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazingThe pacing is just incredible It keeps driving forward towards its conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece While they're often simple (the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone) they're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by itWith its intense action set-pieces, brilliantly paced storyline, and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security, the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age Ultimatum is its peak\n",
            "This is one of the best crime-drama movies during the late 1990s It was filled with a great cast, a powerful storyline, and many of the players involved gave great performances Pacino was great; he should have been nominated for something John Cusack was good too, as long as the viewer doesn't mind his Louuu-siana accent He may come off as annoying if you can't stand this dialect The way that Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was believable, dramatic, and slightly comical at times Danny Aiello was superb as always David Paymer was great in a supporting role Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable There were times when this picture mentioned so many characters, probably too many It may take a second viewing to remember, \"which Zapatti was which\" After so many cross-references, one has to stop and think just to recap The ending didn't have a lot of sting It was built up for so long and then was a bit of a letdown This was one of the few problems with the film Since the movie wasn't billed as a \"huge, blockbuster\" big screen hit, it made some forget that this movie even existed Pacino and Aiello were great but the film's lack of \"splash\" in the theaters may have accounted for no nominations It was semi-successful in the home market, and viewers are still learning that this title is out there Made in 1996, it still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to comeSo, make yourself some lemon pudding (you'll see) and see this movie!\n",
            "For months I've been hearing about this little movie and now I've seen it I find it cute, cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other people's creative ideas in order to make their own one-joke premise of a movie Troops, Swingblade, any of the million Blair Witch parodies come to mind If all that these directors want is a foot inside Hollywood's door then they're doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how Hollywood makes films How many times have you heard the phrase, \"It's Animal House meets Back to the Future\"; \"It's Wall Street meets Dead Poet's Society\"; or \"Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars\" I remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable\n",
            "I have read almost all the books by now, and have seen the musical production in two different languages I absolutely adored everything that I have been acquainted previously But lately I've been running out of resources to sustain my fancy I still have couple of books left, but they are either in transit or they are the sequels which I am not in a hurry to read So an idea dawned on me - Sink me! There are movies which I have not watched! Thus, I must watch them immediatelyThe first five minutes of these series were acceptable In fact, I quite enjoyed the variation of the reason for the denunciation, however different it had seemed It went all downhill from there, though Chauvelin was too foppish And, I daresay, too old for this role Not nearly that dark and dashing figure with his dreadful either-or (And what was that with random bed scene featuring him It was way too creepy - wasn't his only love the Madame Guillotine, and his only interest - his job, and his only obsession - Sir Percy) Marguerite Prettiest woman in France Cleverest woman in Europe I think not Although, whatever compelled her to break into the study of Sir Percy I haven't the faintest idea And whatever my Lord Tony has done to deserve this death Yes, every member of the League did pledge his life to Sir Percy, but he would have never endangered any of them nor would have run away like a coward when his dear friend faces mortal danger And if by any means he had to mourn his companion, he would have done that, mourn, not just move on as if nothing had happened Which brings me to another point, Sir Percy His portrayal was most dreadful He was neither a lazy fop, nor a gallant and elusive hero who is a master of transformations Nor did he care too much about cravats (his pronunciation of that word alone made my ears bleed) And with his own hands he had never killed anyone So what was that with him randomly walking around and slaughtering peopleThe costumes were just too flashy for that time period as well This is post-revolutionary France we are talking about! Not pre-revolutionary People in dresses like that stand out in a crowd quite easily It was all just gah!Although, I must admit, after I watched other parts my opinion did change slightly Watching it as a separate work, independent of Scarlet Pimpernel series, it was tolerable Just your other average hero in the mask But for what they tried to pass it, it is still miserable\n",

            "Speed which I believe is direct copy of the Hollywood movie Cellular (I haven't watched this one) gives an impression of a test match which is very exciting in first four days, but then gets in a very boring draw at the end I have watched this movie today on 12th January 2008 on rented VCD It's release date is 19th Oct 2007 But still fortunately for me I didn't know or heard much of this movie before except that it is a flop at box office So in this situation when I watch the movie, I feel that this movie could have been a very good movie, but then the director again falls in the trap for Bollywood traditions and has wasted a very good chanceOff course as a Bhatt movie it must be copied from somewhere else But now days it doesn't matter for me, if I haven't seen the original movie I just found the main theme much similar to 'Nick of Time' and 'Badshah' In the movie Sanjay Suri is shown an intelligence agent, but his wife thinks that he is a chef This brings back the memory of 'True-Lies' The only new part was the use if the phone But that too I found out now is taken from movie Cellular So when a movie is made with the mixture of so many other movies it's future is quite clearThe things I like about the movie is its pace As the name suggest the things really happens fast, and there is not much time to think about in between the scenes But this breaks in the last 20 minutes of so where the movie goes in traditional Bollywood style of Dhishum dhishumThe plot of the movie is also quite interesting Three stories going parallel, one after the other One of the kidnapping of Urmila, the other of the Zayed trying to help Urmila, and then the plan of murder of prime minister These three stories gets mixed up naturally with each other as the movie continuesBut then the very ordinary acting and unnecessary extra style has killed the spirit of the movie Except Sanjay Suri, none other makes any impression This goes even for Urmila, who is always promising in RGVs movies Due to this ordinary acting some scenes doesn't really convey the feelings that director wanted Eg the scene at the end where Urmila leaves all hope and cut the phone, should have made a good impact But instead we just wait for the end of that sceneOther than acting, some unnecessary love for style demoralizes the movie Showing so cool villains is good for Hollywood movies not for Bollywood The background of London is also only for making style and not much intelligent advantage of this background can be seen Especially at the end, all those dhishhum- dhishhum were utterly unnecessary May be director has an impression that the climax in Hindi movies must have such fights They look unrealistic, increase the length of the movie and make sure that the people are leaving theater before the movie endsOver and all, I find the movie once watchable If it is coming on TV or you can get it on rent its OK But then again make sure that you have the remote and forward button handy Next time, when the movie is on TV, you can safely watch other channels\n",

            "Why do I like DISORGANIZED CRIME so much Why do I chuckle or laugh out loud any time I think of a dozen or more scenes from this movie It's kind of hard to explain, but I'll give it a try First of all, it's very funny indeed - in contrast to what lots of \"official\" reviews want you to believe But then again, that depends entirely on your sense of humour, so there is no sense in arguing about that Often the humour is in the dialogue, and often it is situational comedy There is for instance this very hilarious scene in which the 4 gang members have been given a lift in the back of a truck When the farmer drops them, they just stand there by the road, covered all over with cow s or whatever They are totally unnerved; then, realizing the humour of the scene, they one by one start laughing about themselves, and Ruben Blades (as Carlos), looking (and certainly smelling) terrible, nonchalantly takes out some mouth spray to at least do something about his breath (simply describing the scene here makes me chuckle again!) Which leads to the second point: the acting Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ, Ruben Blades and Corbin Bernsen (okay, the latter overdoes it a bit at times) all fit and play their parts beautifully - in fact, you get the feeling they must have been enjoying themselves too when shooting the film Thirdly, there is the plot  Jim Kouf, the director and screenwriter, is very laid-back; he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves More often than not, there is no real action, and yet you enjoy these 4 very different people - who attempt to rob a bank although their boss (Bernsen) does not seem to turn up - grumble about each other and even-tually, grudgingly, like each other The movie is a fantastic parody of the typical bank robbery plot - totally impossible with all its twists and coincidences, yet utterly convincing in its love for ironic details Incidentally, the title of the film is one of the best I have ever come across, because it per-fectly summarizes the plot in a very ironic way Therefore, take my advice: watch this film, but if you don't chuckle, grin or smile during the first 10 minutes, forget it - it's not your type of film PS The only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay - if you happen to know how, do tell me\n",

            "\"Murder Over New York\" is an entertaining entry in the Charlie Chan series of films, but if you're paying attention, a lot of plot holes reveal themselves to the observant eye While traveling to New York City for an annual police convention, Chan (Sidney Toler) meets former Scotland Yard investigator Hugh Drake (Frederick Worlock) on the same flight Now employed by military intelligence, Drake is tracking Paul Narvo and his Hindu servant, suspected for acts of sabotage around the world Drake believes that by contacting Narvo's elusive wife, he'll be able to pin down the whereabouts of the master criminalWhen Drake winds up dead in the library of George Kirby, president of the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation, Charlie theorizes that he was killed by a recently discovered poisonous gas called \"tetrogene\", administered via a glass pellet that releases the poison when broken Summoning Kirby to bring all of his dinner party guests together, Chan and Police Inspector Vance (Donald MacBride) question those in attendance, as one of them may be the killer Among them are Herbert Fenton (Melville Cooper), a fellow Oxford student of Drake's, actress June Preston (Joan Valerie), unknown to Drake but requested by him to attend, Ralph Percy (Kane Richmond), the chief designer at Kirby's aircraft company, and Keith Jeffrey (John Sutton), Kirby's stock broker Kirby butler Boggs (Leyland Hodgson) is also a suspect, especially after Number #2 Son Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) catches him steaming open a cablegram, the contents of which concern Boggs himselfThere are some other cleverly planted characters in the proceedings as well Mrs Narvo turns up as Patricia West (Marjorie Weaver), and contrary to Drake's suspicion that she might lead him to Narvo, is actually on the run away from her former husband and a disastrous marriage She's involved with David Elliott (Robert Lowery), principal of a chemical research firm, and thereby a suspect in the tetrogene angleAs with many Chan films, racial comments must be taken in stride with the proceedings This one offers two glaring ones When Kirby's black servant is brought in for questioning, he states that he doesn't know anything about Drake's murder, that he's completely \"in the dark\" Chan's response: \"Condition appear contagious\"Later, following Inspector Vance's order to round up all the Hindu's in New York, Jimmy Chan comments on their arrival with \"They're all beginning to look alike to me\" Actually, the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the movie, as Shemp Howard impersonates Hindu mystic \"The Great Rashid\", but is actually uncovered by the police to be con artist Shorty McCoyBefore the movie's over, two more victims fall to the clever Narvo - his confederate Ramullah, and aircraft magnate Kirby himself To uncover the killer, Chan, in concert with Elliott, arranges for a test flight aboard a newly developed TR4 Bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule planted by mechanics on the plane the day before Before it can release it's deadly poison, the Brit Fenton catches the falling capsule in mid-air, revealing that he knew about the plant Arrested and brought in for questioning, Chan asserts that Fenton is not Narvo The real Narvo reveals himself when he offers a poisoned cup of water to the nervous Fenton, anxious to maintain Narvo's secret But Chan was clever enough to be wary of such an attempt, and reveals the real murderer - Narvo now in the guise of stock broker Jeffrey, having undergone reconstructive surgery following a car accidentNow for the plot holes When first investigating Hugh Drake's murder, it was maintained by the police that fingerprints found in the library did not match those of any of the dinner guests However Jeffrey/Narvo was present at the dinner party It had already been established that Drake had one non party visitor in the library, chemist Elliott If the fingerprints really did not belong to Narvo, then making them an issue was pointlessAlso, at the end of the film when Narvo offers Fenton the poisoned water, how did he think he would get away with it with everyone there as a witness But going even one better than that, how would a world traveling saboteur like Narvo have the time and wherewithal to establish himself as a New York City stockbroker, it just doesn't make sense For trivia fans, a few more points bear mentioning In the film, Number #2 Son Jimmy is a college student studying chemistry as he comes to \"Pop's\" aid to solve the case In the prior Chan film - \"Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum\" - Jimmy was a law studentThe poison gas formula would get reworked in a later Chan film, this time by Monogram with Roland Winters in the Chan role in \"Docks of New Orleans\" In that story, poison gas is released from shattered radio tubes in similar fashion to claim its' victims\n",

            "I can't say how closely the film follows the novel, never having read the book, but since this clocks in at some six and a half hours it's a good bet that most of the base are covered or, at least, we can say with some certainty that this isn't a Reader's Digest condensed versionThe production values are high, well up to the standards of other BBC classic series like Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes We can believe Dickens' London looked, sounded, and thought a lot like this There are some occasional minor lapses -- some sportsman firing a pistol with a percussion cap in 1840 or 1820 or whenever this took placeThe acting too is to be applauded Suzanne Burden is the polite and honest heroine who quietly goes about doing good She's cute too, in a mature way, her beauty in her compassionate nature not in any flirtatiousness Denholm Elliott is her guardian (and more than that, as it turns out) Burden and Elliott are two of the very few characters who are good in an unalloyed way Another is a former sergeant forced to do evil by evil people Another is a poor and helpless young boyI don't think anyone else could have written this It's got all the earmarks of Dickens -- poverty, tragic deaths, capitalism in the raw, the generous rich guy in his gated home, hidden parentage, shadowy motives, and the impotence or outright maliciousness of the justice system Well, not the justice system as a whole but the chancery, which was evidently a court that decided matters having to do with the distribution of property (So I gather from Wikipedia) It became so notoriously rigid and dilatory that it was thoroughly revamped in England in 1973 Twice, Elliott's character describes it as \"a curse\" The most impressive scene involves a money-scrounging creditor hounding a retired soldier in the latter's gymnasium during a fencing lesson The sergeant is more masculine in the traditional sense than any other male character I remember from Dickens The apoplectic money lender and renter is screaming threats from his seat and the sergeant turns towards him and does one delicate exercise with the saber after another, each advancement bringing him closer to his tormentor, while the scarlet-faced old creditor shrinks back into his seatA couple of things are missing Often Dickens will stick in at least one or two amusing lines of dialog (\"Humbug!\" or \"The law is a ass\") Not here \"Bleak\" house is the right title Second, there are practically no Weberian \"ideal types\" -- no Mr Micawbers or Artful Dodgers or Scrooges Third, the atmosphere, the whole ethos, is relentlessly dismal One tribulation follows another, usually having to do with money or some shameful peccadillo out of the pastMy God, it's depressing It's as if the author were venting his spleen on everything he hated in the world he knew Poverty, okay He KNEW poverty But one wonders what the chancery did to Dickens to deserve this kind of treatmentMaybe I should add that I've just watched the first episode of the 2005 series -- and it's better in two ways There is more zip in the direction, so the pace is a little faster And the business of Jarndyce vs Jarndyce is explained satisfactorily right up front, instead of lurking about in the shadows as that mysterious \"curse,\" so the plot is easier to follow\n",
            "Greenaway's films pose as clever, erudite and innovative Yet his style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the World War 1 era of film-making: the frame composition, use of mid-shot, the static camera It may be well to rub against mainstream movies with this style but it is not new Perhaps like that other \"innovator\", TS Eliot, he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or couldYet Greenaway's biggest failing is that he cannot write His dialog and even plot structure is mechanical and logical but without the vitality of another dramatic logician, Brecht Where this weakness is most apparent is in his humor, which is poised and logical, so the joke is dead before it's delivered The result is tedium: if it's not funny, it has failed: ask a stand-up comedian to justify their act if the audience doesn't respond Perhaps the well-read director could learn something from Freud on humorFinally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones They speak the lines with a bored, smug air like narcissistic adolescentsThis film, despite its design and lighting, is meretricious\n",

            "Mention Bollywood to anyone with a slight familiarity with the genre and the images usually conjured up are of tacky, over the top musical numbers peopled with costuming that makes Vegas seem a bastion of conservatism This perception is not helped by the whiff of condescension that permeates most movies that have approached Bollywood from an outsider's perspective Willard Carroll's romantic comedy Marigold, however takes a different tack It is not a nudge-nudge wink-wink look at those silly people and their clueless antics but a sincere appreciation of Bollywood for its vitality, its lack of irony and self-consciousnessIt is obvious that the director has a tremendous affection and respect for Bollywood while at the same time is bemused by its kitschier aspects And if you have a familiarity with Bollywood, you can appreciate what he does here in making a true hybrid of Bollywood and Hollywood movie conventions From one of the opening shots, a flashback of the Salman character as a child by the sea, talking with his grandmother (played by Helen! - how many Salman movies start with this same premise) to the flashback sequence that is incorporated into the movie that Marigold and Prem has been filming, anyone who has seen enough Bollywood movies will recognize these references The story itself incorporates tried and true conventions from both Hollywood and Bollywood as well åÐ the fish out of water meets duty-to-one's-family-at the expense of personal fulfillment The structure of the film follows the typical Bollywood plot line of the more comical set up of the first half giving way to a more dramatic resolution of the second Yet ultimately the sensibility of the film is that of Hollywood, with its understated, wry humor and its story of a woman learning to believe in herself, to reach self-affirmationYou couldn't have a movie inspired by Bollywood if there weren't any musical numbers and this movie does not disappoint with seven of them Unlike Bollywood, however, the songs do not pop out of nowhere and transport its characters to a European locale or Goan beach; they exist as musical numbers that are part of the film that is being made, reminiscent of how musical numbers were justified in Busby Berkeley movies as being part of a stage show Or they come out of a situation where music already has a reason to be there åÐ a sexy nightclub scene where Prem teaches Marigold to dance or a beach scene where there are musicians (including a cameo from the playback singer Shaan) performing All reflect the emotional state of the protagonists at that point in the movie Often the music will take a conventional song from one genre and put a twist on it from the other So in one of the highlights of the film where Marigold comes into her own, the song picturazation is fairly typical of its genre åÐ the female star singing and dancing among a line of women åÐ but in this case it's blond Ali Larter looking like a total natural Bollywood film star, emoting and lip synching to the Hindi lyrics with no subtitlesAlso synonymous with Bollywood are sumptuous visuals and Marigold fulfills that aspect beautifully thanks to some of the top talent working in Bollywood today The cinematographer is Anil Mehta who was also the cinematographer for Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam The choreographer is Vaibhavi Merchant and production designer is Nitin Desai, both from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas You can really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam on this film åÐ in fact, the illuminated floor in one of the numbers was originally from Dholi Taro Dhol, which coincidentally has an embedded Marigold patternAs for the cast, Carroll obviously has a penchant for spotting acting talent as evidenced by Playing by Heart åÐ one of the first movies for both Angelina Jolie and Ryanne Phillippe And in this film he again hits the mark with Ali Larter One of the main reasons the film works is because of Larter She makes a bitchy, unappealing character sympathetic and her subsequent transformation believable and she is smart, funny, and sexy because she is smart and funny She and Salman share excellent chemistry and that is one of the film's biggest strengthsSalman Khan plays the role of Prince Charming here as filtered through his iconic role as Prem This is old school Prem, however, so expect a quiet, subdued Salman - those used to him in his usual stripping avatar may be disappointed åÐ or relieved! It's a sincere and sensitive performance from him marred only by poor enunciation of his English linesWith a refreshing lack of cynicism and unabashed embrace of romantic love, the film is a love letter to Bollywood and Hollywood movies of yore\n",

A total classic and one of my favorites now for about 20 years It brings back fond memories of camp and deals nicely with the experience of being rejected by foolish peers and the empowerment brought one by being rescued by a sympathetic adult Tons of great one-liners and quite an assortment of wacko counselors This is the kind of movie where you repeat key phrases among friends for years afterward Also nothing overtly crude and what a sweet late '70's soundtrack to bring on just the right amount of nostalgia I can't say enough about Meatballs; it's a classic Be forewarned!

The grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--there is simply not enough of it The movie is just too long for it's minimal content, too dialogue heavy, and consequently almost impossible to watch What happens To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare, three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered Their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people--one of whom is the psychotic killer All three are eventually murdered, one by one, off-screen, after what seems like an eternity of boring, slow-paced nonsense As I said, the only things worth watching even once are the murders Please don't buy it or rent it just for that, and don't be fooled like I was by the misleading box art and movie description Save your money and your time\n",
            " for Paris is a moveable feast\" Ernest HemingwayIt is impossible to count how many great talents have immortalized Paris in paintings, novels, songs, poems, short but unforgettable quotes, and yes - movies The celebrated film director Max OphÌls said about Paris, \"It offered the shining wet boulevards under the street lights, breakfast in Montmartre with cognac in your glass, coffee and lukewarm brioche, gigolos and prostitutes at night Everyone in the world has two fatherlands: his own and Paris\" Paris is always associated with love and romance, and \"Paris, Je T'Aime\" which is subtitled \"Petite romances,\" is a collection of short films, often sketches from 18 talented directors from all over the world In each, we become familiar with one of the City of Light 20 arrondissements and with the Parisians of all ages, genders, colors, and backgrounds who all deal in love in its many variations and stages In some of the \"petite romances\" we are the witnesses of the unexpected encounters of the strangers that lead to instant interest, closeness, and perhaps relationship: like for PodalydÌ¬s and Florence Muller in the street of Montmartre in the opening film or for Cyril Descours and LeÌøla Bekhti as a white boy and a Muslim girl whose cross-cultural romance directed by Gurinder Chadha begins on Quais de Seine I would include into this category the humorous short film by Gus Van Sant In \"Le Marais\" one boy pours his heart out to another boy confessing of sudden unexpected closeness, asking permission to call - never realizing that the object of his interest does not understand FrenchSome of the vignettes are poignant and even dark In Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas' Loin du 16Ì¬me, Catalina Sandino Mareno (amazing Oscar nominated debut for Maria full of Grace) is single, working-class mother who has to work as a nanny in a wealthy neighborhood to pay for daycare where she drops her baby every morning before she goes to work One of most memorable and truly heartbreaking films is \"Place des FÌ»tes\" by Oliver Schmitz AÌøssa MaÌøga and Seydou Boro co-star as two young people for who love could have happened There were the promises of it but it was cut short due to hatred and intolerance that are present everywhere, and the City of Love and Light is no exception Another one that really got to me was \"Bastille\", written and directed by Isabel Coixet, starring Sergio Castellitto, Miranda Richardson, and Leonor Watling Castellitto has fallen out of love with his wife, Richardson but when he is ready to leave with the beautiful mistress, the devastating news from his wife's doctor arrivesI can go on reflecting on all 18 small gems I like some of them very much The others felt weak and perhaps will be forgotten soon but overall, I am very glad that I bought the DVD and I know that I will return to my favorite films again and again They are \"Place des FÌ»tes\" that I've mentioned already, \"PÌ¬re-Lachaise\" directed by Wes Craven that involves the ghost of one of the wittiest and cleverest men ever, Oscar Wilde (Alexander Payne, the director of \"Sideways\") who would save one troubled relationship Payne also directed \"14th Arrondissement\" in which a lonely middle-aged post-worker from Denver, CO explores the city on her own providing the voice over in French with the heavy accent Payne's entry is one of the most moving and along with hilarious \"Tuileries\" by Joel and Ethan Coen with (who else :)) Steve Buschemi is my absolute favorite In both shorts, American tourists sit on the benches (Margo in the park, and Steve in Paris Metro after visiting Louvers) observing the life around them with the different results While Margo may say, \"My feeling's sad and light; my sorrow is bright\" Steve's character will find out that sometimes, even the most comprehensive and useful tourist guide would not help a tourist avoiding doing the wrong things in a foreign country\n",

            "By 1950, John Ford had already fully-developed the ideas and motifs that would form the core of his most successful Westerns Always present, for example, is a strong sense of community, most poignantly captured in the Joad family of Steinbeck's 'The Grapes of Wrath (1940)' Within these communities, even amid Ford's loftier themes of racism and the pioneer spirit, there's always room for the smaller human interactions, the minor friendships and romances that make life worth living 'Wagon Master (1950)' came after Ford had released the first two films in his \"cavalry\" trilogy åÐ 'Fort Apache (1948)' and 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949)' åÐ and it covers similar territory, only without the military perspective and, more damningly, the strong lead of John Wayne Ben Johnson and Harry Cary, Jr are fine actors, but they feel as though they should be playing second-fiddle to somebody, and Ward Bond's cursing Mormon elder, while potentially a candidate for such a role, isn't given quite enough focus to satisfactorily fit the billIn 'Wagon Master,' Ford seems so comfortable with his tried-and-tested Western formula that any character development is largely glossed over Ben Johnson's romance with Joanne Dru is treated as an obligation more than anything else, and Harry Cary Jr's charming of a Mormon girl is so perfunctory as to be almost nonexistent in the final film, leaving one to ponder the survival of deleted scenes Only in Charles Kemper's charismatic and shamelessly-villainous Uncle Shiloh does Ford try some different, and it works, even with his being surrounded by a troop of insufferably hammy slack-jawed yokels Where Ford does succeed is in orchestrating the conglomeration of three distinct races of Americans åÐ the values-orientated Mormoms, the easygoing horse-traders, the eccentric travelling showmen åÐ into a cohesive community of pioneers looking towards a bright future This apparent harmony is thrown into disarray by the arrival of Uncle Shiloh's gun-toting outlaws, who exploit the lawlessness of the Western frontier but ultimately lose out to the noble cowboys who \"only ever drew on snakes\"Ford reportedly considered Wagon Master among the favourite of his films, and perhaps this has something to do with the absence of big names like John Wayne or Henry Fonda Armed only with his stock selection of usual players, Ford is able to generate a sense of community by avoiding placing focus on any one character, though most of the Mormom travellers still remain completely anonymous Despite being undoubtedly well-made, I can't help feeling that this film only does well what other Ford pictures did even better: the terrific majesty of the the Western frontier was presented more beautifully in 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'; the romances and friendly squabbles among community members took greater prominence in 'Fort Apache'; the early relations with Native Americans, only hinted at here, were more thoroughly examined in 'The Searchers (1956)'; the bold pioneering spirit of the early settlers was explored more movingly (albeit by Henry Hathaway and George Marshall) in 'How the West Was Won (1962)' 'Wagon Master' is pure John Ford, but it isn't a landmark\n",

            "The thirties horror films that are best remembered are always the likes of Dracula and Frankenstein; and there's a very good reason for that, but there were a number of smaller but nevertheless excellent productions, and The Invisible Ray is certainly one of them The plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen many times before (even way back in 1936) but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director Lambert Hillyer has created a very nifty little original horror film The plot focuses on the good hearted Dr Janos Rukh; a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the Earth His discovery leads him to believe that there may be an unknown radioactive element somewhere in Africa and so he sets off along with a team of esteemed colleagues to find it However, tragedy strikes while on the expedition and the good doctor ends up becoming exposed to the element; which makes him glow in the dark, and also sends him madThe biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly the fact that it stars the two biggest horror stars of its day - Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, and both give excellent performances Karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has plenty of meat for Karloff to impress with Bela Lugosi has a role which is extremely different from what we're used to seeing him in, and it's a great performance from him also; it's nice to see a bit of versatility from Lugosi The film does get off to a rather slow start; but things soon start to pick up The second half of the film is the best and that's really when the film gets exciting and Karloff gets a chance to shine (literally) The film does not put its focus on big special effects and largely relies on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting; and it does work very well The film remains interesting throughout and boils down to a very decent climax that wraps everything up nicely Overall, The Invisible Ray may not be one of the very best horror films of the thirties; but it's a very good one and comes recommended\n",

Where did that forest come from Who decided to lay a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area How is this forest, in the last scene, suddenly on a hill over the city in question, while in the scenes inside the forest it looked deceptively FLAT From here I leave the judgment to you, and to your common sense Go and see this movie if you're looking for an unintended good laugh, I can really recommend it\n",
            "Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary about the Zephyr Skateboarding Team, and their influence on skateboarding It also focuses on the history of skateboarding It was directed by Stacy Peralta, a member of the original Zephyr Team, and was written by Stacy Peralta and Craig Stecyk, another member of the team The documentary stars the members of the Zephyr Team and is narrated by Sean PennThe documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding, and how it evolved from surfing It discusses skateboarding's popularity in the late 60s and the 70s, its decline in the 80s and its 'rebirth' in the 90s Skateboarding was introduced in Dogtown, the nickname of the poor side of Santa Monica, California The Zephyr Team originated from the Zephyr Surf Shop, which manufactured the first modern skateboards The documentary mainly consists of the original Zephyr Team members talking about the past in the Zephyr Team, the competitions they won, and their popularity and prestige It focuses on three particular members of the team; Peralta, Tony Alva, and Jay Adams, three virtuosos of skateboarding, and probably the best three members of the teamThe interviews in the documentary were usually voices over archival footage from Dogtown in the late 60s and 70s Very rarely to you actually see the people being interviewed, but when you do, they are shown in black and white, while the archival footage was in colour I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past (ie the Glory Days of the Zephyr Team) and not the present The documentary is very fast paced, in that we often see clips of impressive skateboarding over up-beat music of the era (such as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and David Bowie), and the interviews tend to be quick and to the point Knowing nothing about skateboarding (ie not even knowing how to ride one straight along the ground) I was very surprised that I found this documentary so interesting The reason is that this doco was more about the Zephyr Team than the actual sport of skateboarding, so while I couldn't relate to skateboarding, I could relate to the boys in the team Because it was made by actual members of the team, it gives it a little more depth and authenticityAll in all, I would have to say this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen It gave me a whole new insight, not just into the Zephyr Team, but into skateboarding as a whole For those who love skateboarding, I can only imagine how it must be even more interesting Seven and a half stars out of ten\n",

Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood (cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey), I can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better For example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brother's film, DUCK SOUP, yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp At times, Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho, but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! In fact, he just seemed to prattle pointlessly His only funny quality was that he looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film Additionally, Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as \"who's on first\" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing In fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated I knew that \"who's on first\" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twistOnce again, I have found yet another sub-par film by this duo While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly (such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERS--which I actually gave 6's to on IMDb), this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey Where was all the humor!\n",

            "Recap: A band of five young American men, all that is left of a platoon hit hard during the Ardenne offensive during the WWII get the assignment as a forward outpost and to look for enemy activity They're in really bad condition, both physically and mentally, and think they have struck gold when their outpost is in an abandoned but once plush mansion full with food But after a while there is some enemy activity, and it is very odd Not hostile, but odd It seems like there is a German squad out there, in equally bad condition, that want nothing more than to surrenderComments: Based on a novel and my guess that the novel is much better but the story doesn't seem to translate very well to the big screen Indeed it is a different war movie, much more about the mental pressure during wartimes than fighting and battles But I can almost feel that scenes that must have been full of suspense, full of uncertainties and unknown elements, just fall flat in the movie It is not suspenseful, just different and in many ways absurd Many times people just act insane, and the reasons are unclear or at best hinted atSo when this mental pressure fails to come through, the main building piece of the entire story, I thought the story fell through It wasn't good, it wasn't interesting, it didn't keep me on the edge and it didn't really send a message Actually it did nothingThe cast is interesting, many young actors that then turned into stars in beginning of their careers The acting is good, but not stellar, and a few characters also fell through into the absurd zone Much of that too I feel is due to that this story, these characters need the time, space and pace given in a novel, that they can't be given here And going halfway definitely isn't good enough4/10\n",

            "The writer/director of this film obviously doesn't know anything about film I think the DP on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey, because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun The story was awful, the characters were very one dimensional For someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans, that someone is kidding their self (it was probably the writer/director) No poker fan in this world likes this movie Even your money man hates this project To go into a casino and play a few hands doesn't give you the experience to write about poker Keep your day job And if it's playing poker, then you must be hurt'n\n",
            "I usually try to construct reasonably well-argued critiques of films, but I can not believe this got past the script stage The dialogue is appalling, the acting very dodgy, the accents just awful, and the direction and pacing is scrappy at bestI don't remember the last time I saw a film quite this bad Joseph Fiennes, pretty as he is, might just have killed his career as quickly as it startedThe Island of Doctor Moreau was no worse than this garbage\n",
            "The Running Man is often dismissed as being just another Arnie action thriller full of explosions, bad puns and gunfire, and to be fair, there is a lot of that in it People used to look at it and compare it to the Terminator series, saying it was one of the poorer Schwarzenegger filmsBut, give it 18 years, and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light Rather than just being another brainless action film, it works very well as a parody of reality TV It is quite different to the Stephen King book, true, but I doubt whether Hollywood, with its love of upbeat endings and so-called 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando, would have accepted it in its current formBut, on with the reviewBen Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop working in a dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past, and the entire country is ruled by a government/media conglomerate amalgamation The economy is in tatters, food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch, like Jumping for Dollars, where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs, and the most popular one is The Running Man, a gameshow hosted by the slimy Damian Killian (played by the entertaining Richard Dawson) where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical, pro-wresting-esquire 'stalkers'Some, however, try and speak up against the government When a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of Bakersfield, California, a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to 'calm' (ie kill) the protest When Richards refuses to fire on innocent people, he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd He is sentenced to a slave labour camp, but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and goes on the runHowever, his freedom does not last long, and after he kidnaps network employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to escape those pursuing him, he finds himself taken prisoner again, but this time he is forced to appear on The Running ManAnd there, of course, the entire film kicks into standard Arnie mode Richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles (why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds) and forced to run from the 'stalkers', along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him Amber also becomes curious about Richards' protestations of innocence, and discovers he was framed Guess what happens to her, then So, as Amber, Richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers, we soon become aware that Richards is no ordinary cop He's Super Arnie, the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in Christmas lights all while being just your average American guy with an Austrian accentYes, the remainder of the film becomes dumb, loud, classic 80's Arnie fun There's a lot of exciting fight sequences, the trademark dreadful puns ('He had to split' being my favourite), and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending It's a lot of fun watching Killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way, as well, and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the cursing old lady!) and the cold, cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratingsIf you expect a high-brow, intelligent film, you'll be disappointed But if you want a great 80s flick, well, this is it But the great thing about this film is it was quite propheticIf you look at the entertainment we have today, you'll have noticed the way reality TV is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame, and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on TV It's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile TV exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on TV We've already had that, however, with the ghoulish al-Qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet It seems that in the current climate, at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television setsWith that in mind, and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s, you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film Of course, we haven't reached there yet, as it's terrorists, rather than the mainstream media, who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death, but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity\n",
            "I understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent I have sat through many movies that don't particularly hold my interest, but I can appreciate from a constructive point of view in how it is being received by my children Parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their children's activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in children's movies Disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to fathom how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear their nameTechnically, the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds over-dubbed and unnatural Personally I hate that, but it was doubly awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a 12 year old for a school project The \"acting\" reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices Thankfully it was a very short movieNow, before I come off like a video-geek measuring a kids movie with an adult yard stick, the one thing that can save even the worst children's movie is a positive message Far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is Let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given: If you are lost, don't worry, you will inevitably find your way homeApproach wild animals without any fearYou can win any competition just because you \"know\" you canand my favorite, the final message left in the film: It's okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right\n",
            "Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of \"Picture of Dorian Gray\" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwrightOn screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed)The acting however is brilliant Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella Jeremy Brett is also strong,offering a touching portrait of the anguished artist Basil HallwardPeter Firth,while not originally my vision of Dorian, handles the role with style and graceand later with a convincing strain of cruelty The supporting cast is equally fine, Gielgud's former 'Importance Of Being Earnest\" co-star Gwen Francon-Davies plays his philanthropic Aunt Agatha with dignity and Judi Bowker makes a touching Sybil Vane The wit,pathos and tension of Wilde's work have been remarkably transferred to the screen My only other qualm is with the hair styles Many of them seemed out of place,looking more like 1970's versions of Victorian hairdos rather than the actual style Overall however,the acting and writing elevates this production to a high level of small screen excellence\n",
            "This film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities, it's like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula 1 Grand Prix (not I might add, the US Grand Prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win), that is how far short this film falls Now don't take this the wrong way, I love B-Movies, around half my collection is made of B-Movies but I don't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film isFirst of the story (for a B-Movie) isn't that bad, it has potential there to make a B-Movie brand, were not talking Friday 13th potential, but potential none the less But what really lets this film down is the acting, at not one second do I believe anything, it's like watching QVC except the presenters on QVC tend to have a heavier tanIn summary I'd like to say I've seen worse films, but I can't\n",
            "\"Balance of Terror\" is still one of the best Star Trek episodes ever made It was inspired by the film \"Enemy Below\" (starring Robert Mitchum), a movie that deals with a cat-and-mouse game between two captains during World War II In this episode, Captain Kirk and his crew play similar game with a Romulan vessel This is the program that famously introduces the war-hungry Romulans, who are distant relatives of the Vulcans It is an incredibly suspenseful episode, tightly constructed for maximum effect It is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra layers of meaning to the story Mark Lenard makes his Star Trek debut as the Romulan Captain (he will later play Spock's father Ambassador Sarek) A must-see episode!\n",
            "What is most striking about this semi-musical set in 1920s Berlin is the marvelous cinematography and editing It's top of the line from First National in these departments The story is mildly engaging and similar to the plots of Miller's other two films (SUNNY, SALLY) where working girl is romanced by rich boy with family disapproval, complications and final clinch All the four musical numbers are bunched at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without any further musical buoyancy Miller sings parts of I THINK OF BABY and reprises BECAUSE OF YOU There are also DON'T EVER BE BLUE and THOUGH YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST ONEMiller here is very engaging and delightful, quite reminiscent of Irene Dunne in manner and delivery Sad she does not dance as that is her forte SALLY remains her finest film, with this trailing as second and the rather poor SUNNY a vastly inferior runner up Her life was tragically cut short by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable It's worth visiting these films though to see Ziegfeld's top star of the twenties\n",
            "Honore De Balzac's genuinely bizarre short story on which this was loosely based gets an unsettling, albeit breathtakingly filmed, treatment here as a sort of forbidden-love blossoms over a period of time between man and beast in the early part of the nineteenth century Thin and very blonde English actor Ben Daniels plays the role of a young soldier during the Napoleonic wars who gets lost whilst escorting an exiled() french painter across the rugged, dangerous landscapes of the Gobi Desert After literally going around in circles the two men give up ever trying to reach civilization again, thus each decides (against better judgment mind you) to go their separate ways with the promise of both returning to the same exact spot when and if a water source is actually found This is of course how Daniels' character comes to encounter the creature (a wild and untamed female leopard) and eventually form a seemingly unbreakable bond, or rather love, with it that both saves his life and nearly destroys it by film's end The exquisite cinematography, minimalist dialog, somewhat demented story which arguably hints at possible bestiality in about three scenes are what ultimately lead professional critics to pan the film as pretentious and overlong rubbish While it is a film that isn't exactly for all tastes mind you, I find it to be a subtle, though decidedly left-of-center mixture of fantasy with a surreal and sumptuous atmosphere, highlighted by the fact that for more than half of the flick actor Ben Daniels is forced to perform opposite a wild animal (four leopards were actually used as opposed to just the one), which plain common sense and a slight knowledge of theatrics dictates that it must have been a maddening and very difficult job that he managed to pull off quite brilliantly if you ask me! Overall, I think that \"Passion in the Desert\" takes a while to warm up to, but if you're a patient person who is willing to give it some time it does in fact cast it's uniquely original spell over you in spite of everything; and unlike most platonic human and animal relationship stories it need not require a talking pig, monkey or shaggy dog to keep your interest throughout ( out of )\n",
            "I suspect there's some revisionist history going on here,but one definitely comes away with the feeling that Patrice Lumumba was a trouble-maker who incited his people to violence from the moment the Congo declared independenceHis inability to control his people and his decision to bring in Soviet help to get his military back in line was obviously what got the United States involved and led to his assassinationHowever,by replacing him with Mobutu,the United States didn't solve anythingThey made the situation just as badWell-acted with excellent cinematography and a rousing scoreDefinitely worth seeing\n",
            "I saw this series in 1999 in London TV and was blown away Like another user commented - This is what i would have liked to see when i first watched \"Jurassic Park\" - Life and death of Dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a documentary The CG are very lifelike, and the diversity of dinosaurs and habitats shown makes it also very educationalThe series takes everything factually known about dinosaurs, adds a lot of good ideas on \"what it could have been\" to make up what then looks like a documentary series What i missed was some small bar-graph constantly in one corner of the screen, moving between \"fiction\" and \"fact\" along with the narration and the pictures, because you often wonder how much is educated guessing, and how much is pure fantasyTo some clues on facts & fiction, you have to see the 50 minute \"Making Of\", which is not only very educational about the CG process and collecting and including the paleontologists knowledge into the series, but which also is very funny (Dinosaurs smoking cigarettes and complaining about CG animators)I highly recommend to watch this series before going into the upcoming Disney Dinosaur movie or watching any Jurassic Park (like) movie again It will surely make you much more critical towards those movies The Disney Trailers looked especially bad\n",
            "Before this, the flawed \"Slaughterhouse Five\" was the best But this screen adaptation of \"Mother Night\" is very true to the book and keeps the comedy, mystery, and tragedy intent Thankfully it wasn't Hollywood-ized or idiotized a la the movie of \"Breakfast of Champions\" Another good thing about this movie is that you don't have to be familiar with the book to follow it (as I think you do for Slaughterhouse Five) That's probably true of Breakfast of Champions also but they did such a bad job of that you're better off just reading the book and not seeing the movie! Nick Nolte did an excellent job in this film\n",
            "To me, \"Anatomie\" is certainly one of the better movies I have seen I don't think \"Anatomie\" was primarily intended to be a horror movie but a movie questioning the ethics of science If you watch it with that in mind, it turns into a really good film The only annoying bit was the awful voice dubbing for the English version How can you expect any non-German person to listen to these unbearable German accents for two hours Let native English speakers do the talking or use subtitles instead!!\n",
