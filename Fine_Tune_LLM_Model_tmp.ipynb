This movie lacks any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have seemed old even in the fifties, the only thing it really has going for it is some pretty ladies, but really, if you want that you can rent something from the \\\"Adult\\\" section.

Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes. Not for the faint-hearted \\u0096 just the thick-headed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I understand the dissatisfaction with the final product by both families. But this is a great movie, it was a great Opera; but as a film it is wonderful. This film should be released at least to video, other generations can gain an appreciation of great music and story telling. The cast was made up of some of the greatest Black actors ever, most have now passed away; only Sidney P. is still with us. Please don't wait until he is gone and the film as all old film does, becomes unusable do to the ravages of time. Again this is a great film which is something that one does not see very often today, if at all.\",\n          \"Despite the lack of logic present in the storyline, Kill Shot is a highly enjoyable film. Through a moving performance Kasper Van Dien brilliantly portrays the emotional rift between a hard working wealthy father and his misguided son. Each member of the supporting cast pitches in with a solid performance, highlighted by the vivid acting of a young asian man whose name I cannot recall. A shockingly tragic ending may unnerve some younger viewers, but as a whole Kill Shot truly delivers a death blow.\",\n          \"Absolutely corrosive! Director Arthur Hiller and writer Paddy Chayefsky dismantle the American hospital system with this wicked comedy/drama/whodunit. The hospital depicted here is fraught with problems...from protesting neighbors to irate patients to a potential serial killer on the loose. George C. Scott is the top doctor who, on the brink of his own nervous breakdown, gets involved with free-spirited Diana Rigg and her wacky father Barnard Hughes. Alternately depressing and uproarious, THE HOSPITAL features some of the most acid-tinged dialog imaginable (note how Scott describes his love making session with Rigg). It also has a lot of great vignettes: Scott berating head nurse Nancy Marchand after one of here underlings accidentally kills a doctor; daffy administrator Frances Sternhagen trying desperately to collect insurance info from a waiting room full of sick people; Scott getting sobering advice from the hospital psychiatrist after telling him of his woeful home-life. All of the acting is first-rate. Scott and Rigg are dynamite and Hughes is a real surprise. The movie is a masterpiece with Chayefsky's script earning a well-deserved Oscar (over such stiff competition as KLUTE & Sunday, BLOODY Sunday). The opening narration is priceless.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "I always wrote this series off as being a complete stink-fest because Jim Belushi was involved in it, and heavily But then one day a tragic happenstance occurred After a White Sox game ended I realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow Now I could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote, or even to the TV to turn the channel But then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch TV in another state \"Nuts to that\", I said So I decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever Fate had in store for me What Fate had in store was an episode of this show, an episode about which I remember very little except that I had once again made a very broad, general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with, and once again I was completely right! This show is a total crud-pie! Belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn The women are physically attractive but too Stepford-is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer There is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local TV station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell Except Except for the wonderful comic sty lings of Larry Joe Campbell, America's Greatest Comic Character Actor This guy plays Belushi's brother-in-law, Andy, and he is gold How good is he really Well, aside from being funny, his job is to make Belushi look good That's like trying to make butt warts look good But Campbell pulls it off with style Someone should invent a Nobel Prize in Comic Buffoonery so he can win it every year Without Larry Joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking Courtney Thorne-Smith smacking Belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell designated Comedic Bacon because he improves the flavor of everything he's in!\n",

            "This movie was so poorly written and directed I fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie The jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles, it is too far fetched and at some points- ridiculous If you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed, but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts (which I might add are poorly done) and wish you were some warrior to The casting in this movie wasn't very good, and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it didn't fit at all On a scale of 1-10 (10 being excellent, 1 being horrible) the acting in this movie is a 4 Brenda Song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of movie, in some of the more serious scenes, her acting was laughable When she made some of her \"fighting\" poses, I started laughing out loud I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing, for example, the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing, how her voice turns dark and evil, I think that was incredibly stupid, and how Wendy's (Brenda Song)teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks, that was pretty ridiculous to So to sumamrize it all, a disappointing movie, but okay if you're 10 or under\n",
            "The most interesting thing about Miryang (Secret Sunshine) is the actors Jeon Do-yeon, as Lee Shin-ae, the main character, is a woman with a young son whose husband has died in a tragic accident, and who leaves Seoul to live in Miryang, which was his home town, with her young son Jeon's face is very changeable She is girlish, flirtatious, elegant, aged and sad, desperate and joyous, with it and terribly isolated by turns, and it's all in her face The film also stars Song Kang-ho as Kim, a man who meets her when her car breaks down coming into Miryang, who happens to run a garage in town, and who follows her around all the time thereafter, despite her apparent lack of interest in his attentions Song is the biggest star in Korea right now, renowned for his work with Park Chan-wook and Bong Joon-ho (Sympathy for Mr Vengeance; Memories of Murder and The Host) And yet here he plays a throwaway character, almost a forgotten man But of course he makes him interesting and curiously appealing He is the essential ballast to keep Jeon's character from floating awayLee Shin-ae is a piano teacher She comes to the new town, which is a neutral place, a kind of poor-man's Seoul, a town \"just like anywhere else,\" as Kim says (just as he is in a way just like anyone else) Her little boy is sprightly, as little boys are, but plainly damaged and withdrawn at times too His father used to snore, and when he misses him he lies awake, pretending to snore He goes to school, and Shin-ae meets parents and students and shopkeepers There is a sense of place in the film, even though the place is in a sense \"anywhere\" People speak in the local dialect, and everyone knows everything, and Shin-ae's Seoul origin is immediately noticed Is life really harsher here, away from the big city and its sophistication Shin-ae seems not to realize the danger she is inSomething terrible happens And Shin-ae doesn't necessarily deal with it in the best possible way But it happens and she must face the consequences But she can't She goes to pieces A perpetrator is caught, but that's no consolation Eventually she becomes so despairing, she relents and goes to a born-again Christian meeting an acquaintance has been pressing her to attend She finds peace and release with this But when she decides not only to forgive the perpetrator but to go to the prison to tell him so, that experience is full of ironies and it destroys her all over again She becomes embittered and desperate and she no longer finds solace in religion And it gets worse than thatJeon Do-yeon gives her all in this extremely demanding and protean role Lee Chang-dong may be a very good director If an actor of the stature of Song Kang-ho expresses enormous admiration for him, that is convincing According to Scott Foundas of LA Weekly, Lee's first three films, Green Fish (1997), Peppermint Candy (2000) and Oasis (2002) have marked him out as \"one of the leading figures of his country's recent cinematic renaissance\" But this is not as successful a film as those of other Korean directors whose work I've seen, such as Yong Sang-Soo, Bong Joon-ho, and the prodigiously, almost perversely gifted Park Chan-wook It may indeed begin as Foundas says as a kind of \"Asiatic Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\" and then \"abruptly and without warning\" turns into \"something of a thriller, and some time after that a nearly Bressonian study in human suffering\" But that progression not only seems random and indigestible; the film sags and loses its momentum toward the end and then simply fizzles out, with no sense of an ending There are also weaknesses in the action Shin-ae takes foolish chances with her son, and makes bad choices all along If she is destined for madness like Betty in Jean-Jacques Beineix's Betty Blue, which might explain her peculiar and mistaken choices, that isn't something that is properly developed This is an interesting film, certainly a disturbing one, but one that leaves one doubtful and dissatisfied, after putting one through an emotional wringerAn official selection of the New York Film Festival presented at Lincoln Center, 2007åÑan event that has done right by Korean filmmakers in the recent past\n",

            "I saw a screening of this movie last night I had high expectations going into it, but was definitely disappointed Within 5 minutes of the opening, Williams is already campaigning for his presidency And he becomes president in the first 40 minutes So there goes all that aspect of the movie The first half hour are hilarious Don't get me wrong, the movie has its moments But after the first half hour, it takes a turn for the worst It becomes less of a comedy, and more of a thriller/drama/love storywhich is pointless the movie goes nowhere and stands still for a good 30 minutes there are laughs interspersed here and there, but the consistently funny part is in the beginning and only the beginning at one point, the biggest cheer i heard in the audience is when a person in the crowd yelled 'boooo' during a very confusingly emotional scene Williams gives a great performance, right on par with his comedic style Walken also delivers a strong supporting role as only he can I think the one character that goes underrated is Lewis Black Consistently vulgar and political, its funny to see him tone it down for a PG-13 rating Overall, I would not pay to see the movie Afterall, I saw it for free and even I was disappointed The first half hour is solid, and its all downhill from there Not really fitting into a category, the movie realizes half way through that it should not have been anything more than a one-hour comedy central special 45/10\n",

            "I had a recent spectator experience with The Perfect Witness (2007) because the NetFlix computer recommendation engine suggested I watch this film Apparently, at some point, I told it how much I liked Michael Haneke's, Benny's Video I don't know about you, but this parallel being drawn provoked in me a maelstrom of emotion and excitement over Thomas C Dunn's film and made the allocation of my time toward it virtually impossible to refuse Just this kind of recommendation from the NetFlix computer intelligence, for me, had the aesthetic/moral movie bar set to level so high that, upon reflection, it represented something pretty much unaccomplished in every film produced in the year 2007Having prefaced my response to the film that way, I'm going to proceed in knocking this picture down as poorly executed and banal; and I really hate to do that because I think our boy, Wes Bentley, happens to be not only one of the most interesting young faces in contemporary cinema, but also one its most overlooked and underrated screenacting talents in the US I'm more than moderately concerned that the poor guy's going to miss the fame ship if he keeps fiddling around with first time movie directors like thisThe Perfect Witness is about Micky (Wes Bentley), who, about thirty, still lives with Mom (\"You're not drinkin' again area ya's\"), but he's a \"filmmaker\" or at the very least some kind of street-level voyeur with a pension for shooting would-be Johns in the seedy back alleys of Philadelphia with his DVX 100B Out there, doing his private investigator-like drills, Micky \"inadvertently\" video-tapes a brutal murder on a hapless early-twenty-ish coed with his hand held camcorder Baring the notion in mind that snuff and movies as cultural currency can be his equated with his ticket out of the white urban ghetto (and not to the debts of his unwitting friends and relatives who put up the money for his atrocious films), Micky approaches the assailant, James LeMac (Mark Borkowski: also takes a writing credit) or \"Mac the Knife\" åÐwhichever- and blackmails the killer into making a documentary about his murder impulses, holding this found footage over the attacker with threats of the policeThe problem with this movie is not that no interesting ideas exist because they do While both the writing and direction are amateurish, that alone doesn't make a film bad It's that these guys commit a rather poor assumption that what they are presenting is shocking in the context of a culture in which just about any person in the free world with access to a private computer can log-on to the web and catch the veracity of the action of a beheading on their little Mac or PC No film relies on shock value alone any more (unless of course, ironically, it's a film about torture on animals) and therefore cinematic images of violence (real or fake) have less and less cultural capital with each year that passes Also, we've got this astounding actor-talent in the lead all styled-up, real hip guy: his two inch beard and skull cap with the little bill on it, backwards, just like the dork from high school who craved after the potential services of my primary love interest åÐsame guy who just now calls himself a \"poet\"Spare me \"I'm an artist,\" \"I'm a filmmaker\" Okay Please do, carry on with that shtick, Cronnie Seems to have bought you a lot of expensive 35mm stock And go ahead, you can wear all the accrutements of a \"creative\" but don't expect us top respond to you, to follow your below average character through your two hour movie while you take down Wes Bentley's career Why don't we just let history speak to the merits of what you do, filmmaker guy My guess is history will eventually have say something about that åÐlike, probably that's in not is good as you think it is And yeah, odds are you'll be laying the blame on your dear ole ma, end up like our man Micky here in The Perfect Witness; hooked on smack and covered in your buddy's blood with a video camera in your hand Great\n",

            "All day now I've been watching dinosaurs, and all day they've had the same fundamental problemThey don't believe in firearms They just don't seem to have been _told_ about them or something Bullets _bounce_ off of dinosaurs! Maybe it's because they became extinct millions of years before the invention of gunpowder, and the laws of physics were just different back then Aah, no Come on If they're close enough to chemically operate today, they'd have to be vulnerable to fast (even subsonic) lead projectiles It's that simpleLook, the toughest-skinned reptiles on the planet today, alligators and crocodiles, are completely vulnerable to basic rifle fire They're nothing magic You can shoot a pistol round right through the heavy scales on their backs They don't take armor-piercing bullets or anything special Small bullets penetrate them, they just don't kill them Somewhat (but not REALLY) large bullets are preferred because the challenge (as with most game) is to kill the animal with one shot, so it doesn't run (Hunters consider it immoral to allow prey to run off and die unharvested)Most animals, including predators, are easily repelled by gunfire Between the noise, and the pain of even a non-lethal wound, most will run away An exception are big bears, which are so fearless that they're merely enraged by mortal wounds Cape buffalo are regarded as highly dangerous because they are well known to charge when wounded We've seen video of the big bulls of a herd of cape buffalo rescuing a calf from an entire pride of lions A big cat will run if it can, but if it can't it will charge as a final act of desperation Where a TRex would fit in this spectrum is unknown Their behavior simply has not been observed With these larger animals, safe hunting becomes a matter of applying an appropriately large and powerful projectile, and/or applying several of them rapidly enough to counter its charge With a TRex, of course, this could be a serious problem I've seen a TRex skull (they have one in the museum downtown) and carrying a gun big enough to bust that might be impractical Chewing its neck off with lots of smaller fire might be a more viable approach Small bullets would still _penetrate_ them, they wouldn't just bounce off just because the animal is too big to easily kill! So here we have Cortez and his men (this is _before_ the famous Mexican campaign, apparently) captured by American natives and scheduled for sacrifice on the pyramid It appears that all those human sacrifices were about appeasing the bloodthirst of the pair of TRexes that terrorized the continent in the day Rather than just having their hearts cut out and being fed to the lizards, Cortez et al talk the Aztecs into letting them hunt & kill them OK, maybe they don't have M-16s like the guys in the \"Carnosaur\" series, but they _do_ have flintlocks, crossbows, pointed sticks (big ones, made from trees) and swords Maybe that's a little less uneven than squads of soldiers with full auto, but they've several guys and I'd quickly bet on them over a dinosaur Oh, wait, there's a _cannon_, about a 4-incher That's just the ticket for busting a Tyrannosaurus' skull! So they lay a trap, with a squad of men, cannon, pointed sticks in a ravine, and lure the first TRex into it, using a pretty brown girl as bait Cortez points out that they'll NOT have time to reload, so they'll have to close the range until they can be certain of their aim TRex totally ignores their volley of flintlock fire, and we see both a crossbow bolt _and_ the cannon ball _bounce_ off! Forget it End of credibility A crossbow bolt would defeat Cortez' torso armor, and a 4\" cannon ball might penetrate the hull of a wooden ship! This would also _certainly_ get through the hide, ribcage, or skull of any animal ever to walk this planet (Do you think a _whale_ could withstand a 4\" cannon ball) And here's TRex, still standing, not even bleeding So Cortez lures it to the ravine, where it falls onto the pointed sticks, which (I guess by magic) penetrate it and kill it Yaaay, pointed sticks! The dinos aren't completely invulnerable to gunfire - they manage to put out an eye of the second one with a pistol This runs it off, so it's NOT as mean as a bear or a buffalo, at least in the moviesThey kill the second dinosaur with a bomb - made from a gourd filled with gunpowder and gemstones My money would still be on the cannon It's engineered function is to concentrate all the gunpowder's energy in one direction - toward the target A bomb is a much more diffused application of force A _real_ bomb (NOT a gourd bomb) has a steel casing which contains the explosion to extremely high pressure (Think: pipe bomb vs firecracker) A pile of gunpowder set on fire will simply go POOF (Trust me on that one)\n",

            "Like several other reviewers here, I'm surprised to see many negative reviews on this film Dan O'Bannon's previous effort was the groundbreaking 'Alien' of 1979 Because it and 'Star Wars' introduced the stylistic approach of 'Used' or 'Dirty Space' in art-direction for these kinds of features doesn't mean that this was the only way to produce themRather than dismiss 'Lifeforce' out-of-hand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature, it's important to recognize that the film draws upon the 'esteemed' traditions of British horror and science-fiction - specifically Hammer and American International features like Quatermass (specifically 'Quatermass and the Pit', 1967), Doctor Who and 'The Day of the Triffids' (1963), if not the works of Gerry Anderson ('UFO', 'Space:1999' and 'Thunderbirds') But none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer O'Bannon's genre-scholarly appreciation for 'Queen of Blood'(1966) and 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space'(1958) - the immediate sources for 'Alien' (1979)Granted this film has some 'legacy' elements, but perhaps it's worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers - 1981's 'An American Werewolf in London' and 'The Company of Wolves' (1984) - other 80's films that share a 'looking-back' while they adapt those stories to the 80's zeitgeist All three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same, but substantially sexed-up their themes (because they could), and, at the same time they recognized the tongue-in-cheek, humorous aspects of their projectsNeil Jordan's 'Wolves' played to many of the psychoanalytic memes floating around at the during the '80's, while 'American Werewolf' curdled its theme as a 'coming-of-age' film It's called artistic license, and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latter-day dramedy inherent in the 'Scream' franchise, 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Final Destination' But these teen-targeted, films seem to be part of a box-office trend, whereas the 80's films like 'Lifeforce' belong a canon of British sci-fi - even if this one was written by an AmericanIn many ways this film holds up much better than latter-day disaster and alien-invasion flicks ('Independence Day', 'Armageddon', 'Deep Impact') in that the 'solutions' don't reside in gun-battles, weaponized payloads and testosterone At the opposite end of the pole, it is unfortunate that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron didn't examine Tarkowski and Lem more closely before they remade 'Solaris'The goal of this film was fun, not ponderousness or stupidity7/10\n",

Long after I had stopped searching I found out about Paperhouse åÉåÉPaperhouse is based on a favourite book that I own, called Marianne Dreams Paperhouse had also come up in some of the books I had found on horror films, but they didn't tell me about the link between book and film I discovered the truth while on the Internet, I bought the film later that dayI thought Paperhouse would not be faithful to the book and dull Unfaithal it certainly was but dull certainly not It was the answer to my prayers Marianne is renamed Anna in the film but most of the original story is the same One day in school Anna draws a house in her scrap book (nothing remarkable about that) then she becomes ill and every time she faints or falls asleep she finds herself outside a creepy old house (and I mean genuinely unnerving) More she also finds that every time she puts something new in the drawing it appears in the dreamworld, EG an apple tree Anna draws into the dreamworld a rather sad boy named mark who apparently is a person in the real world Mark is a cripple but wants to leave the house, obligingly Anna draws in a lighthouse (a place to go to) but still the problem remains mark can't walk So Anna decides to draw her father in she gets her pencil out and gets too work, but the outcome is deformed and unsettling Anna particularly dislikes his eyes Quote \"he looks like madman\" So Anna tries to rub him out and start again, but the pencil proves indelible (that means nothing can be rubbed out) Then Anna loses her temper and crosses out her father's eyes! I leave you too find out for you self the terrible consequences of the rash actionPaperhouse truly is the British answer to A Nightmare on elm Street! The viewing of this film left me shocked and upset But I have found what I was looking for after 2 years The question is how dose the compare with Psycho Answer, 1 the old dark house, 2 psychological parental fears, 3 a genuine shock, 4 and very scary music\n",
            "This Harold Lloyd short wasn't really much; not one of his funnier efforts Of course, I never see bratty kids as anything hilarious That's what the bulk of this story is, Harold and his wife, Mildred Davis, babysitting his in-laws two young kids One is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a four-year-old terror who does everything but demolish the house Letting the kid create havoc over and over was not entertaining to meThe best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thinks that this big goon (Noah Young) is burglarizing their house Half the time it's the pet cat scaring the couple, but overall, that segment is fun with some good sight gags, reminding me of another Lloyd short, \"Haunted Spooks\"However, the good ending doesn't save the whole picture, which I probably wouldn't watch again Lloyd has done too many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this one again It just isn't that funny\n",

            "Yes, this film has many gay characters It also has straight characters, characters who are not sure about their sexuality, people who are searching for some truth about their existence This is not a film about sexual orientation It's about loneliness and the difficulty human beings often experience in connecting to one another Filmically, Denys Arcand cleverly balances the various dimensions of the relationships and the contrasting, constantly shifting relationships The serial killer element is a bit less successful (it feels more like a way to wrap up various plot points and, unlike the rest of the film, is thematically heavy-handed) Thomas Gibson centers and grounds the film; it's a quiet performance but behind the handsome, arrogant exterior he slowly reveals a terrified soul afraid of showing or accepting love from those around him The supporting cast is strong, especially Mia Kirshner as Gibson's friend, a dom-for-hire with precognitive powers Her role is more metaphor than a literal conceit---strangely innocent and depraved at the same time, she represents the light and dark of the characters' sexual consciousness The film's involving and often surprises in its character development The effect is somewhat like Robert Altman directing a David Mamet script---the dialogue doesn't shrink from some searing observations aside from a few contrived moments in the beginning Often, in our search for love and a conventional \"relationship\", we ignore the love that already exists around us---in our friends, family, those who are able to see us as we are Arcand and the writer, Brad Fraser, make some canny observations on the different ways human beings try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that denial returns to haunt us in so many unexpected waysThis film is a rewarding experience It may not be for bigots who can't get past the sexual orientation of some of the characters to see the greater, transcendental message of hope and redemption Loneliness is a universal experience A film like this, that dares to explore the darker side of our lives with a clever and perceptive eye, deserves applause and an open-minded approach\n",
            "The first thing that struck me about this movie was the terrible acting The whole cast was so uniformly inept at delivering their lines that I started laughing at the awful dialog midway through the film An even bigger issue with this movie is that at no point do we ever find out what motivates the actions of each character The one somewhat redeeming aspect of the movie is Halfdan Hussey's innovative visual effects However, as eye-catching as they may be, they do little to make up for the gaping flaws mentioned above A dreadful script mixed with community theater level acting does not make for a pleasant viewing I was honestly shocked at how bad this movie was\n",

But it was really excellent for its limited budget and for its portrayal of the Britain of the early 80's, exploding with rebellious youth, looking for a way out of the dole queue I went to Britain only a couple of years later and found the movie to have been very reflective of the atmosphere I found when I was thereIf you get a chance to, see it It is a great movie, with some wonderful performances, and the music will blow you away\n",

During the film, he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer-dudes & dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark-congested area The only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location Even though it's a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this, the lagoons and nature looks marvelous Every other aspect is simply disastrous There's a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable The dialogues are downright painful to listen to! You won't believe some of the lines these actors have to say! I know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope for their own sake they're not that stupid! Early in the film, one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a 'mechanical toy' but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than Spielberg's great white shark The visual effects in 'Blood Surf' are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress I won't say too much about the acting since it's secondary in flicks like this The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast You guessed right: Blood Surf is a very bad film So bad it becomes fun again But 'funny' for a whole other reason than James Hickox intended\n",

            "Summary: Not worth the filmAs an avid Gone With the Wind fan, I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters Luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece When the book Scarlett came out, I read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together While the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as I was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable However, I consider the six hours I spent watching the \"Scarlett\" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life Discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in Margaret Mitchell's book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character In the novel, Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family After coming to an \"arrangement\" with Rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah Eventually, she accompanies her cousin Colum, a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood, to Ireland, to further explore her family's \"roots that go deep,\" and is eventually named \"The O'Hara,\" the head of the family While her duties as The O'Hara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara, Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties She, having been scorned by Rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry Luke, the earl of Fenton, until Rhett comes along in a clichÌ©d \"night-on-white-horse\" - type of a rescue The \"Scarlett\" miniseries fails even to do this justice Raped by her fiancÌ© and scorned by her family, the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committedI heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision\n",

            "A Scanner Darkly, Minority Report, Blade Runner, Sin City and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow åÐ if you are a fan of any of these then this will be well worth checking outFrench animation project 'Renaissance' took seven years to make on a shoestring budget and tonight I finally got to see it at a private screening for the International Film Festival in Stockholm My spontaneous reaction is awe; my further reflection is 'huh, neat' and closer analysis regrettably gets a resounding 'meh' It is a gorgeous science fiction triumph on the surface, but scratch it or even poke it a little and its unnecessarily complex plot becomes glaringly apparent, as do the flat characters Nevertheless it is clear that the people at Onyx films have done something spectacular with the aforementioned surface The visuals are staggering They have used live action motion capture fitted into key-frame animation, with stark jet black and bright white contrasts and a heavily shadowed rotoscoped background For those of you who are not down with the 'technical lingo', the film looks like a fully-animated Sin City Its fluid, transparent, dark and stylized template is complemented by great lurid lightning It's a vision Yet much credit is also due to the crisp sound effects that take the form of humming futuristic weapons, suspenseful music, heavy raindrops and glass shards breaking It's every tech-nerd's wet dreamThe film zooms in on an eerily-lit, bleak, futurescape Paris in which a major corporation called 'Avalon' has begun to interweave in the lives of the citizens with surveillance (think the fluid transparent screens from Minority Report) and genetic engineering The latter leads to a mysterious kidnapping of young researcher Ilona (voiced by the lovely Romola Garai) Cut to our hard-boiled cop-on-suspension and protagonist Karas (Daniel Craig) åÐ a man who takes the law into his own hands åÐ who is assigned the case of finding and retrieving Ilona During this case, he is being aided by Illona's sister with whom he also begins a love affair A very half-assed love affair, if I may say soThe world of Renaissance is remarkable Director Christian Volckman takes a fair jab at melting the noir themes and the result is an urban jungle filled with cads, rats, femme fatales and lonely detectives that hide in the shadows of the seedy slum The problem is that the creators undoubtedly felt the need to have extremely clear and spelled-out archetypes in the story, or the film would have been \"too surreal\" for mainstream audiences, owing to its lurid animation format It follows then that we have a multitude of clichÌ©d characters such as evil-laughing villains, sleazy crime bosses and butch tough-chicks who blow smoke every chance they get It shoves noir in our faces, and it isn't necessaryWhat is worse is that the dialogue is a little contrived It seems as though every line exists for the sole reason of propelling the plot This is nothing fatal because the plot is so complex once it gets going that it needs some clear direction Daniel Craig helps here too by bringing a no-nonsense attitude to his hard-edged cop character At one point in Renaissance, he is seen in a vivid car-chase that surely is one of the most adrenaline-pumping and top notch sequences of the film Unfortunately, the novelty of the sci-fi visuals have worn off post this car chase and 'Renassaince' could benefit from being slightly shorter In summary, a very interesting but flawed futuristic comic book experience7 out of 10\n",

Beyond my suspension of disbelief How did the characters who have come in contact with Arnold's character turn against him later in the movie I laughed out loud when I recognized the good-stepmother-turned-evil-stepmother is the same actress who played a nanny in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet Her ironic transition from that film to this was absolutely hilarious if you can imagineAll the mindlessly huge explosions and gunfires What did you expect in the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicleThe Devil took a man's body comprising of flesh and blood, yet he's invisible to bullets and explosions by healing through that body Logically, this is impossibleAs the Devil demostrates the illusion in the apartment, Arnold's character runs into the solid Christmas tree that supposedly is an illusion and falls on it physicallyThe Devil is capable of punching the person's brains out and twisting a victim's head 180 degree, yet he could not kill Arnold's character as he always intends toHow the Devil's object of desire's parents died and why evil New Yorkers run after Arnold and the object of desire were never explained at allIn the sequence that's a rip-off of Speed, Arnold and the Devil's object of desire manage to escape the subway train wreck by the short distance inside unscathed This is beyond my comprehension, since the force would be enough to throw Arnold and the object of desire around violently and die from fatal wounds seconds after impactArnold suffers the brutal beating from the mob sanctioned by the Devil and put him on the cross to hang against the wall, yet the Devil forgot to take the time and opportunity to kill him for convenience's sakeAt the beginning of the movie, after the Devil took over a man's body, all of a sudden Arnold is his bodyguard Is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editingArnold's recital of cringe-inducing dialogues in the particularly laughable scenes like \"YOU ARE A CHOIRBOY COMPARED TO ME!\" are the perfect fodder for MST3K, just as Eraser did with the classic line \"You're the luggage!\"The whole theory about 666/1999 is downright ludicrous So are the pseudo-religious babble about the Christian theology involving the end of the world at precisely midnight and the fanatic killers who know the location of the Devil's object of desire (END SPOILERS)It is highly ironic that End of Days uses the scattered profanities abusing the deity while rambling about Christian theories The level of violence in the film is excessive and gruesome, and is therefore unnecessary to serve the plot The director's indulgence of excess is a factor here He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of moneyHence, End of Days is a worthless film with no redeeming value except for campiness -- Arnold's worst since Hercules in New York     \n",

            "There's the danger with the critic/philosopher Slavoj Zizek with his film, directed by Sophie Fiennes, which takes together a wonderful amalgam of silent, horror, sci-fi, surreal and other contemporary thrillers together to make his points ofr Freudian comparisons to overload But in the Pervert's Guide to Cinema he also makes even the more far-reaching points a point of departure from any other analysis I've seen on a collective section of films While it doesn't cover the expansive territory Scorsese's movie documentaries cover, the same attachments are there, and Zizek has a definite love for all of these \"perverse\" examples and films, primarily the work of Hitchcock, Lynch, Chaplin and Tarkovsky Yet one shouldn't go into seeing this- if you can find it that is, I got to see it almost by luck- thinking Zizek will just try and dissect all of the psycho-sexual parts or parts referring it in an obtuse, deranged manner If anything he opens up one to points that might never be considered otherwise- would one think of three of the Marx brothers as representations of the Id, Super-Ego and Ego (Harpo's example is most dead-on for me)He's not just one to take on the classics though, he also considers the food for thought in The Matrix and Fight Club- in representations of the split between fantasy and reality and if the matrix needs the energy as much as the energy needs the matrix for the former, and in the attachment of violence in dealing with one's own self as well as ones double in the latter He even throws in a piece from the pivotal moment in Revenge of the Sith when Anakin becomes Darth Vader, and the implications of shunning away fatherhood under that back mask at the very moment his children's births happens elsewhere The ideals of fatherhood, male sexuality, the male point of view in turning fantasy into reality (at which point Zizek rightfully points to as the moment of a nightmare's creation), and female subjectivity, are explored perhaps most dead-on with Vertigo This too goes for a scene that Zizek deconstructs as if it's the Zapruder film, where he dissects the three colliding points of psycho-sexual stance in the 'don't you look at me' scene in Blue VelvetNow it would be one thing if Zizek himself went about making these sincere, excited, and somehow plausible points just face on to the camera or mostly in voice-over as Scorsese does But he goes a step further to accentuate his points of fantasy and reality, and how they overlap, intersect, become one and the same, or spread off more crucially into some netherworld or primordial feeling for some characters (ie Lost Highway) by putting himself IN the locations the films take place in Funniest is first seeing him in the boat \"heading\" towards the same dock Tippi Hedren's boat heads to at the beginning of the Birds; equally funny is as he waters the Blue Velvet lawn he goes on to explain the multi-faceted points of Frank Booth; only one, when he's in Solaris-like territory, does it seem a little cheesy But Zizek seems to be having a lot of fun with this set-up, and after a while one bypasses the potential crux of this gimmick and Zizek's words come throughThere were some films I of course would've expected, chiefly from Hitchcock and Lynch, but a treat for movie buffs come from seeing two things- the movies that one would never think of seeing in a film about films titled the Pervert's Guide of Cinema (top two for me would be the Disney Pluto cartoon and the exposition on Chaplin's films, albeit with a great note about the power and distinction of 'voice'), and the ones that one hasn't seen yet (ie the ventriloquist horror film, Dr Mabuse, Stalker, among a few others) that inspire immediate feelings of 'wow, I have to see that immediately, no questions asked' Zizek is a powerful writer with his work, and puts it forward with a clarity that reminds one why we watch movies in the first place, to be entertained, sure, but also to have that actual experience of sitting down and having something up there, as he put it, looking into a toilet It's probably one of the greatest films about cinema, and in such a splendidly narrow analysis of how Freud works its way into films regarding desire, the Id/Super-Ego/Ego, and of the supernatural in fantasy, that you may never seeunless distribution finally kicks in, if only on the smallest levels\n",

I don't want to talk about this movie anymore, it's making me angry I just wonder if the director even watched it when it was done(SPOILER ALERT!!!! SAVE 5 DOLLARS!) the monster is just a bunch of ants that \"evolved\" so now they need bones so they can move around, (nevermind the fact that this serves no evolutionary advantage whatsoever, and that the ants just killed whoever was available, though the movie acts like they kill out of necessity This movie made me dumber) The end consists of the lead idiot killing the mother ant (a big blob thing) which destroys all the other ants Pretty cliche eh He almost wusses out at the end because of a sudden emotional attachment to the mother-thing that overcomes him Give me a break\n",

            "Superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80's exploitation, hooray! The pre-credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we're dealing with a serious and harrowing drama, but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we're up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles, rough fist-fights, lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity! Bo and Ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship Can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister's naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes Well, Bo does that to his sister and, judging by her dubbed laughter, she doesn't mind at all Sick, dude! Anyway, as kids they fled from Russia with their parents, but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy A friendly smuggler took custody over them, however, and even raised and trained Bo and Ingrid into expert smugglers When the actual plot lifts off, 20 years later, they're facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable White Fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine Very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of \"White Fire\", but it sure is a lot of fun to watch Most of the time you have no clue who's beating up who or for what cause (and I bet the actors understood even less) but whatever! The violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded The script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly åÐ and I won't reveal for what reason åÐ Bo needs a replacement for Ingrid and Fred Williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes Bo's principal opponent is an Italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent, the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film, there's the obligatory \"we're-falling-in-love\" montage and loads of other attractions!

            "This movie was horrible and the only reason it was even made was because the story appealed to the far-left I consider my self a moderate, so I was able to see this film as the pile of garbage it was While I'm not a Bush fan, your dislike for GW is not enough of a reason to see this movieTo start, the movie was shot on such low-grade film that it comes off as cheap, rather then artsy Additionally, the characters are seriously lacking in depth Chris Cooper's character was a poor parody of George Bush; better suited for Saturday Night Live then a Dramatic film The rest of the characters are walking clichÌ©s and are poor facsimiles of other characters from much better moviesAvoid this movie at all costs!\n",

            "Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I didn't know this one The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw \"Breakfast of Champions\" and \"Hotel Rwanda\" But the film brought me a pleasant surprise Of course Nolte was great, but so was the plot There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans (and, as it later turns out, Americans) towards Jews or Hitler Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism The dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken, not even as narration Howard Campbell Jr (Nolte) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up, not even in his memoirs The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film manages There are other points to it, such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichÌ©s (like the song White Christmas), that make it real different from average American movies I recommend it to everyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies\n",

            "It's hard to watch this movie without thinking forward to the television show it would become, especially if, like me, you happen to like the TV show more But there's a lot to be said for the sourceOscar Madison (Walter Matthau) is a top New York City sportswriter who lives in an eight-room apartment by himself, a casualty of divorce and his own stubbornly sloppy mindset Enter his friend Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon), needing a place to live after his wife threw him out for his stubbornly neatnik mindset The result is a train wreck and one of the most beloved movie adaptations of a Neil Simon stage playFirst thing's first: I love that apartment! Poker table, novelty dart board, askew photos of baseball players, empty booze and beer containers, even a pair of Roman columns It's a place where men can be boys Simon and director Gene Saks do a great job opening up the stage play's single set, Oscar's living room, by moving the action into the bedrooms and kitchen and giving the mounting tension between Oscar and Felix more corners to bounce off ofNeal Hefti's familiar score was heard on the TV show, but never so sweepingly orchestrated as it is here, in several different arrangements that make the on-screen action soar whenever its played Real location work and night shots of Manhattan give the film an energy common to films shot in that place and time (\"Buddwing,\" \"The World Of Henry Orient,\" \"Midnight Cowboy,\" \"Manchurian Candidate,\" \"Rosemary's Baby,\" etc)Are Lemmon and Matthau too heavy in comparison to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman To be fair, the movie is meant to be a more serious affair, dealing with the then-uncommon condition of mid-life divorce and the frustration inherent in not being able to make a relationship work Simon has more in mind than entering Felix and Oscar in a game of \"Password\" or a battle of wits with Howard Cosell But I don't knowBoth Lemmon and Matthau were terrific comedians I enjoy watching especially in the middle of this film as I often do in their separate movies, but I never understood why they were regarded as a great comedy team Here, in their best-regarded partnership, they seem to be acting in two different films; Lemmon in a comedy-drama and Matthau in a farce Matthau is great in the beginning, charming us with his teddy-bear demeanor around the poker table, but near the end of the film he takes a turn much like Jack Torrance's in \"The Shining,\" reacting to Felix cleaning up his apartment and serving tasty food to his friends in a way that totally upsets the delicate balance of blameWhile the ending bothers me, the part many see as the most jarring, the beginning, works fine as I see it Watching Felix stumbling around trying to kill himself isn't great comedy, no, but it's a good way to get into a great comedy, setting us up with some real-life pain before bringing in the warmth and laughter (Plus it has some great shots of the seedier parts of the city) In the middle of the movie, this scene would have been a miscalculation, but it works as a way of establishing Felix's torment and a sense of sharp relief to come when we see Oscar and his poker friends bicker and feudThat's where Simon's lines are so great They are the underlying strength of the film He gets the banter exactly right and real, and still makes it funny \"I don't mind you talking, Felix You got things to say What's scaring me is I'm beginning to listen\" The TV show showed how wrong it is to assume the movie is always better, in fact the TV show once made a good point about \"assuming\" anything at all, but the movie makes for a solid foundation and is a joy in its own right\n",

Yes, BLINKS! I recorded it as it came on HBO this past weekend and when I saw this I literally had to replay it several times, focusing on one eye at a time to make sure that I was not seeing things! Of course, after that, it was hard to take the movie seriously although there were a few interesting and intense scenes with Julian Sands Very disappointed and give it a 4 mostly due to the fact that the 1st victim blinks in one of the last frames as the camera pulls away from the body/face Too bad\n",
            "Judging by some of the comments in IMDB, I was expecting an action movie - perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid one or a simple one or a comicy one, but essentially an action movieWhatever it is that I watched, it certainly didn't feel like a movie The story is simple and straightforward (even though the prologue tries to make it seem complicated) Take three interest groups: 1) the government 2) the rebels 3) a group of assassinsNow subtract the first (they never appear in the movie) Then simply let one of the assassins, the princess, become a rogue on a revenge trip Add in a rebel love-interest with a guilty conscience And you've got the ingredientsBut they still did not manage to turn it into a story or a movie Between some random action sequences and some odd visuals trying to be Sci-Fi on a low budget, what you're left with is a feeling of emptiness The movie just does not feel like a movie, but a weird, incoherent, boring dreamAvoid2/10\n",

            "This isn't a very good movie, but it is easily the best Troma Studios film I have ever viewed Lloyd Kaufman - the \"brains\" behind Troma - isn't concerned with a good plot or even making a moderately entertaining film His chief concern is making something bizarre And his definition of bizarre oftentimes mirrors my definition of terrible cinemaIn this film we have the titled character Luther - whose favorite pastime isn't Baseball, but biting the heads off of chickens - receiving his release from lockup The board has deemed him rehabilitated despite the fact that he doesn't speak - he merely clucks like a chicken - and has a set of razorblade dentures at his disposal Of course, once Luther is set free, he goes about causing mayhem, first at a grocery store and later at a farm houseVIOLENCE: $$$$$ (Lots of violence in this oftentimes tasteless flick Luther sinks his razorblade chompers into a poor elderly lady waiting at a bus stop and then spends the rest of the film terrorizing the mother and daughter at the farmhouse)NUDITY: $$$$$ (Stacy Haiduk delivers some noteworthy skin in his picture, as the former Lois Lane (I can't recall which Superman edition she was from) gives us a shower scene followed by a romp in bed with her boyfriend - a guy who just doesn't have any chemistry with Ms Haiduk The extended shower scene footage in the DVD extras gives the viewer quite a bit more of Stacy She is quite something)STORY: $ (Forgettaboutit!!!! Whitey Styles' screenplay may just be the worst ever written The way in which Luther is released from the asylum completely throws all credibility out the window His dialogue is something that a pre-schooler might write and the actions he writes for his characters border on the absurd It's as if Styles spent ten years without human contact and completely forgot how people react in certain situations)ACTING: $$ (The film belongs to Edward Terry who actually does a decent job as the Geek He is quite menacing in a stupid barnyard fashion Joan Roth as the mother does a super job in support but Haiduk and her boyfriend's lack of chemistry made their roles awkward at best)\n",
            "I've rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on DVD without reading any reviews about it So, after 15 minutes of watching I've noticed that something is wrong with this movie; it's TERRIBLE! I mean, in the trailers it looked scary and serious!I think that Eli Roth (Mr Director) thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid, the movie would be funny(So stupid, it's funny WRONG!) He should watch and learn from better horror-comedies such as:\"Fright Night\", \"The Lost Boys\" and \"The Return Of the Living Dead\"! Those are funny!\"Cabin Fever\" is THE reason why I registered to wwwIMDbcom so I can release my thoughts of discontent about itI've decided to watch the movie a second time AAARGH!How bad can a script and a director be This bad Here are the awful scenes in chronological order:In the early scenes we see Henry, who doesn't realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead-glazed stare is dead!The movie doesn't explain anything about the blonde long-haired kid who like to bite peopleAnd my answer to Marcy's unanswered question (\"What's wrong with the woods\") is \"nothing\" The script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for \"suspense\"Then the \"smartest\" of the 5-pack, Bert, almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire He meets now-infected Henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the \"F-word\" Bert starts to freak out because Henry looks awfully ill Bert:\"Don't make me shoot you!\" (he forgets to add: \"with my BB gun!\")Bert heads back to the cabin but how about that He meets Marcy and Jeff who were having sex, but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk! Marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire Bert had started earlier (A moment of clarity for a change) Bert doesn't mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his BB gunLater, as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire, another weirdo shows up with his dog (Maybe that's what the warning about the woods is all about It's filled with weirdosand their dogs!) They let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis (Their brains are completely intoxicated! No wonder why they are all so DUMB!) This is the last time we'll see this forgettable characteralive!Henry shows up at their cabin, (NOTE: He was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin!!!) looking worse, almost like a zombie, covered in goo! He says he needs a doctor But the Young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker He gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition Henry almost seems smart enough to drive the Hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard, seats and windows The Fantastic Five come out running, armed with: a BB Gun, a knife, a baseball bat (huh Ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods), a poker, and a (insecticide) spray-can, ready to combat the single, unarmed and terribly sick man (clever script!) Bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his BB Gun, which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth \"What else am I supposed to do\" Bert yells in his defense Jeff and Paul try to knock Henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck's windows instead Henry walks up to the dumb girls who say: \"He's coming towards us!\" (Thanks for the info, dumb broads, I can see that! But I don't think he wants to do you any harm!) Marcy sprays in his eyes, making Henry yelp! And our \"hero\" Paul touches Henry's arm with a burning log from the campfire, which they recklessly left burning while they were INSIDE the cabin! (Where has all that wisdom gone I guess the cannabis had started to take its toll!:-) Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away, screamingThe following day, Bert and Jeff head out for a mechanic And Marcy decides to \"go for help\" all by herself, in the woods, as Paul stays behind with KarenDoesn't that sound idiotic Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already \"going for help\"!I skip my comments now to how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE rowing over a huge and winding river! How did she get a canoe Does she even know where she's going! Anyway, she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and, like in most horror movies, walks inside the cabin saying:\"Hello Is anyone there\" Bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her (and me at first) And along comes Jeff, as well How did THEY get here! Did they swim across the river Do you see how brainless the script is!Deputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin He somehow doesn't notice the blood on their truck This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the DVD out (Before I take my own eyes out!Now, THAT's funny!)If you liked this movie, do yourself a favor and watch \"Fright Night\", \"The Lost Boys\", or \"The Return of The Living Dead\" Then you'll see they are MORE entertaining than thisthing Even the \"Toxic Avenger part 2\", which is also a lousy film, is way MORE funnier than \"Cabin Fever\"\n",

            "In the small American town of Meadowvale Dr Anthony Blake (David Gale, the IMDb listing for this character is wrong it's definitely Dr Blake not Dr Blakely) is the director and founder of the famed 'Psychological Research Institute' and also host's a local TV programme called 'Independent Thinkers' He uses this TV show to hypnotise the viewers and make them commit acts of violence Dr Blake has the help of a large brain with an evil face that uses it's spinal cord as a tail thingy Usually the brain is just sitting in a tank, eats mice and the odd bad actor, each time it eats someone it gets much bigger Meanwhile at the local high-school gifted but troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski (Tom Bresnahan) has been caught putting Sodium down the toilets Jim is sent to Dr Blake at the PRI for help with his attitude and behavioural problems While there Dr Blake hooks Jim up to, well something I'm not actually sure what This whatever it is, is attached to the brain At first Jim is able to resist the brain's mind control The brain feels that Jim is a threat to itself and it's plans Once out of the PRI Jim starts having bizarre hallucinations and crashes his car Jim makes it to his waitress girlfriend Janet (Cynthia Preston as Cyndy Preston) but is handed back to Dr Blake's assistant Verna (George Buza) soon after by Officer Marks (Harry Booker) The brain wants to kill Jim because he is the only one capable of withstanding it's mind control techniques, and with 'Independent Thinkers' going national the brain doesn't want anything or anyone to stop it's evil plan for world domination! Jim quickly realises that the brain is controlling the entire town and he alone must stop the brain, before it takes over the world!Directed by Ed Hunt who calls himself Edward Hunt here, the Brain wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be Don't get me wrong as it certainly isn't great either The script by Barry Pearson tries a stab at satire with the brain washing and mind control by TV storyline It moves along at a fair pace and isn't too boring No explanation is given for the existence of the brain at all, it's just there and that's it we have to accept it The story is a little choppy and never fully explores one single element, there's the TV mind control, the brain itself, Jim being hunted by the police & his misbehaviour and various other little bits and pieces here and there including a bizarre revelation regarding Dr Blake that isn't explained at all Production wise this film looks cheap, and probably was cheap The acting isn't great but I've seen worse, and what is David Gale doing in this In fact this role is similar to Gale's role in Re-Animator (1985) even down to his character's deaths in both films The brain itself at first sits in a tank and starts to grow whenever it eats someone and by the end it is pretty big Each stage is just made of rubber It doesn't look particularly good and isn't scary or creepy, just cheap There's no blood or gore in it apart from a blink and you'll miss it decapitation The nudity is provided by Dr Blake's assistant Vivian (Christine Kossak as Christine Kossack) before she gets eaten The brain had a certain entertainment value for me but I would think most people would dislike it Maybe worth a watch if you can see it on TV for free\n",

            "A sharp political comment posturing as a coming of age story is what this movie is The annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels It isn't supposed to but it does This tale of four boys and a girl growing up in 1953 Communist Belgrade is a heart warmer It is what gentlemen refer to as classic cinema Obviously, 1953 Belgrade is not as harsh a dictatorial and fascist environment as the Communist society is often portrayed One can listen to rock and roll music, one of the songs played is the song \"Hey Babu Riba\" ala the title of the movie But jeans cannot be bought nor certain drugs which are illegal to possess Unlike a heavy-handed criticism of a communist society this movie does it by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as we four The girl who has a father in exile in Italy and is awaiting a passport for her mother and she to travel out to join him, the piano that is taken away from communion use from one of the boys, the sudden giving of your home and quarters to your new comrades because they need it The boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is made clear they despise the fascism that communism has created as they engage in tiffs with a fascist charlatan who has Stalin tattooed on his hands These all leads to the actions they take later on and the remembrance of a time fading away, as this movie was released in 1986 in the twilight of the Soviet Empire A great movie worth seeing again and again \"Repentance is not your enemy but yet it is also nobody's friend\"\n",

            "The beautiful, charming, supremely versatile and talented Irene Dunne is one of the greatest 5 or 6 actresses of American cinema In Over 21 - as in all her films - she lights up the screen with a natural, yet glamorous presence She is simultaneously authentic and human, AND a charismatic, inspirational model This role is quintessential Irene Dunne, full of pathos and wit and a little mischief I love all of her films, and this film was a fantastic new discovery for me when TCM aired it last night I hope they don't wait years to air it againLikewise, Charles Coburn is one of the greatest character actors in all of American filmdom True, he often portrays variations on the same theme, but I never tire of watching his soft-hearted curmudgeons Here his character is the perfect foil for Irene Dunne, and he is portrayed perfectly by Coburn Their conflicts in this film are absolutely fantastic They never miss a beat In addition, they represent the central conflict of the film and the moral conflict of Irene Dunne's husband, portrayed by Alexander KnoxI am not as familiar with Knox's work He was recognizable, but that was about all However, cast with Dunne and Coburn, he holds his own He delivers a fine, nuanced performance His character has noble motives that are made accessible to us by Knox's performance and never held over us like some holy grail He is noble, but conflicted and doubts his ability to successfully complete OCS His interaction with Dunne, is always convincing, too Dunne supports him without being syrupy or becoming a martyr, and he responds in kind Their scenes are very well doneThe film, itself, is a fantastic snapshot of a moment and a milieu not portrayed in other movies I don't recall off the top of my head another movie that portrays America still fighting WWII, but with the end in sight and the focus on the establishment of the post-war world Not the usual WWII movie! That in itself is interesting; it is also essential to the plot and the movie's message In contrast to other commentators, I thought that the climactic speech was okay, but not great It was delivered very well by Knox, but it was not as \"tightly\" written as the build-up led me to expect I have heard better cinematic speeches addressing very similar themes It served its purposeFor me, the greater value of the movie, was the depiction of the life of Dunne and Knox, as it reflected the typical OCS experience The sense of community among the wives living on Palmetto Terrace seemed absolutely authentic - as did Palmetto Terrace, itself, despite the fact that it was obviously a sound stage set The incredibly brief encounters between the wives and their OCS husbands The rigors of the OCS candidates, mastering the difficult and complex material they had to learn The shabby \"base housing\" - obviously hastily constructed The tired and worn furnishings The constant and harrowingly short deadlines - for returning to base, for learning lessons, for catching trains to subsequent \"posts\" Tenants constantly running into their predecessors and successors in the base housing, as they were moving in and out Yes, I suspect this was a glimpse of a real WWII experience - clothed in some comedy, but very real at its core I loved it, and I recommend it highly\n",

            "Tierney's an authentic tough guy, but this movie misfire from normally competent RKO undercuts his impact at every turn The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner Just count the times Tierney's incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts The old clichÌ© about it \"only happening in the movies\" applies here in spades Then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy, ruining the menacing mood in the process The static one-room sets don't help either, and neither does director Feist's obvious lack of feel for the material Then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty flat In fact the movie only picks up in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants Too bad that Tieney's career never really gelled I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best Anyway this project might have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment\n",

            "Looking backwards to that year 2002 when \"Furia\" was made, one can easily recognize the heralding sings of today's New Generation in RomaniaThe main qualities of \"Furia\" stand in a very solid script, with a substantial dramatic core and a really professional developing, plus a cast of excellent actors All four leading roles are admirably performed, both with depth and casualness: Dragos Bucur and Andy Vasluianu confirmed, since then, being two of our best performers today, Dorina Chiriac follows them closely, and Adrian Tuli, a non-professional (in real life, a graveyard manager!) cast as Gabonu, was a genuine revelation! Further, Radu Muntean's directing is skilled and expressive, creating in a very compelling style that feeling of \"a fateful night\" and inescapable destiny One can easily pass over the few awkward and even failed moments, since time proved them to be only the uncertainties inherent to a debut, never repeated in his subsequent movies: \"HÌ¢rtia va fi albastrÌ\" and \"Boogie\"\n",

he is a Quaker, whose religious principles forbid him to bear arms, and was serving with the Union forces as a medical orderly The film is set in Louisiana towards the end of the war and starts with the injured McBurney being discovered by a young girl named Amy and brought back to her boarding school The school is a small one, with only two teachers and a handful of girls Although some of the girls are ardent supporters of the Confederate cause and want to hand him over to the authorities, the headmistress, Martha Farnsworth, decides to shelter him and tend him, fearing that his injuries are likely to prove fatal should he be sent to one of the Confederacy's notoriously harsh prison camps Although McBurney scrupulously follows the teachings of his religion as regards pacifism, he is not so scrupulous when it comes to following its teachings on the sin of fornication, and as he starts to recover he makes full use of his opportunity to exercise his charms on both the staff and the older girls, and he wins the affections of number of them, including Miss Farnsworth, her assistant Edwina and Carol, one of the older girls Even twelve year old Amy appears to have a sort of childish crush on him In the sexually repressed atmosphere of the all-female school his presence gives rise to jealousy and hatred, and Miss Farnsworth, rejected in favour of the sluttish Carol, plots a terrible revenge (Interestingly, the one female to resist McBurney's blandishments is Hallie, Miss Farnsworth's black slave, even though he tries to win her round by pointing out that he is fighting to free people like her) \"The Beguiled\" has been described as an anti-war film, but this seems to me to be a misconception The film is not really about the rights and wrongs of the Civil War or of war in general The only acts of violence we see are perpetrated by non-combatants, and they are motivated by a desire for personal revenge, not by zeal for the Confederate cause It would be more accurate to see the film as a drama about the psychological stresses that can be caused by the peculiar circumstances of war At the beginning the school, set in a beautiful old antebellum mansion, seems like an island of peace amid the war The building is in the Classical style, associated with order, harmony and restraint, but the story that unfolds within its walls is one of disorder, passion and violence, qualities associated with the Gothic school of writing which in the 19th century was often regarded as the antithesis of Classicism The film can be seen as falling within what has been called the \"Southern Gothic\" tradition in American film and literature The film was not a great hit at the box office, possibly because Eastwood was cast so much against type It is not perhaps his best film, but it did show that he could expand his range and play something other than action heroes (In \"Play Misty for Me\", his first film as director made the following year, he was again to play a \"passive\" character in danger from a vindictive female) There are some very good performances from the female members of the cast, particularly Geraldine Page as Martha Farnsworth, outwardly a respectable middle-aged spinster but inwardly a woman of strong passions (There are hints that she may have been having an affair with a man whom she passed off as her brother) There are also good contributions from Elizabeth Hartman as the shy, repressed Edwina, who falls in love with McBurney and rejects the idea of revenge and from young Pamelyn Ferdin as Amy (Amy is an animal lover- a key moment in the film comes when McBurney kills her pet turtle- so it is interesting that in later life Ferdin became an animal rights activist) The one character I was less keen on was Jo Ann Harris's Carol who seemed too modern, like a swinging seventies chick transported back in time to the 1860s The film is notable for the emotionally intense \"hothouse\" atmosphere which Siegel brings to it This will not be a film which is to everyone's taste; some will find it too overwrought and melodramatic, and some have found it misogynistic (Judith Crist called it a film for \"woman haters and sadists\") Others, however, may find it a compelling psychological drama 7/10\n",

            "TV News producer, Jane Craig (Hunter) meets Tom Grunick (Hurt), an up-and-coming news presenter, at a seminar, and their mutual attraction takes them back to her room Romance, however, is cut short, when it emerges that Tom is, in his own words, \"no good at what I'm being a success at\", and Jane realises he personifies everything she hates about where TV news is going The rub comes when Tom reveals he is about to join her news bureau in WashingtonJane and Tom's initial attraction is therefore given a second chance, but will Jane be able to put aside her professional opinion of the man she finds herself attracted to - and should she Aaron Altman (Brooks) is Jane's highly intelligent reporter colleague and confidante Despite his obvious talent, Aaron's career is stalling as he lacks the confidence and people skills - and the classic good looks - to be the success that his new, less qualified and less intelligent colleague - Tom - is becoming He is also concerned that his good friend Jane maybe falling in love with Tom, despite her better judgement, as it becomes increasingly clear that Aaron has his own romantic feelings for herThis central romantic plot is set within the trials and tribulations of a TV news network office, where moral dilemmas and ethics are wrestled with quickly and where appearances and dramatic effect are becoming more prevalent and importantThis is where most of the bite comes from with well-observed comment and scenes One of many moments is a scene where Tom meets the Network's top anchorman, Bill Rorich (a cameo role for Jack Nicholson), for the first time, and the camera focuses on their handshake In a film full of great lines and dialogue, long and short, you realise a lot about these two men's character from this one quick shot of two handsThe dialogue between characters is amongst the most intelligent and witty you are ever likely to find anywhere on film and in such abundance Brooks gets the best portion of them, in line with his character, but even the briefest conversations that are incidental and perhaps over-heard by one or more of the characters as they move through a crowded room, should be listened toHunter is a tour-de-force in this role for which she was rightly (and not alone) nominated for an Oscar, and for which she probably would have got if it was for a role in a film that didn't mock part of what had become a closely related industry - and against a strong performance from another actress in a more traditional feel-good, rom-comBrooks is also excellent as the constantly frustrated and occasionally too-smug-for-his-own-good, Aaron AltmanHurt, whilst possessing the looks and providing the personality required of his character, does not always convince that he is quite as dim-witted the character says he is or is supposed to be He displays a latent intelligence that enables him to make the most of his apparent limitations, which may be plausible, but I don't think Hurt quite pulls it off Apart from when he tells us he \"stinks\" or \"doesn't get it\", Hurt comes across as a bit smarter than that Otherwise it is an effective performance, in a role where his character is compromised by its intellectual limitations, but Brooks and Hunter slightly overshadow Hurt's performance It is the only negative thing I can say about the whole film, and who is to say that anyone else would have done it better, or come off any better, when next to Hunter and Brooks and their performances in this movieSupport is ably provided by, amongst others, Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles and Joan Cusack, and there is also a bit-part role for Christian Clemenson of subsequent Boston Legal fame, and the briefest of bit-parts for Joan's brother, John Cusack, whose face you don't even seeJames L Brooks has provided us with many great TV shows and movies, and this film should rank up there with the very best of them It may not have won any Oscars, despite seven nominations, but it did win plenty of other awards, and turned Holly Hunter into a star\n",

            "I saw it at a German press screening Without giving too much away: Most critics really seemed to like it very much There was even applause afterwards, which is quite unusual for that species From my point of view and until now, it was the funniest movie of the year It keeps the charm and wit of the three W+G shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies Of course, there are obvious allusions to monster- and werewolf-movies, especially to \"An American Werewolf in London\", \"Jaws\", \"King Kong\" and even to Peter Jackson's \"Braindead\"/\"Dead Alive\", but also to other genresCharacterization was better done in \"Chicken Run\", but that movie had a complete new \"cast\" where introduction was necessary Here, you are already able to know the two main characters So, the new \"Wallace and Gromit\"-movie is enjoyed best if you watched (and liked) the shorts already, yet it also works on its own \"Chicken Run\" had the more convenient, but also more \"storytelling\" plot Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more \"isolated\" feeling of the W+G shorts Children should also enjoy it very much, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you love cute bunnies, this is a must-see for you!!!) and because Gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show (children also love dogs :-) ) But many jokes are thought for a more adult audience (there are even soft sexual allusions in it) The movie manages, like \"Shrek 1+2\" and \"The Incredibles\", to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family, with adding a British and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of American animated moviesThe animation is åÐ as expected åÐ superb, and they kept true to the Aardman style because they didn't put in too many digital effects - I realized just a few when it came to Wallace's inventionsFinally, the score works fine in the movie, although one of the main themes definitely is \"borrowed\" by Randy Edelman's \"Dragonheart\" scoreThe bad thing is: It will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from Nick Park & Co\n",

            "In August Days/Dies d'agost Marc Recha has given us a sun-saturated Catalan documentary-style road movie that's mostly a meandering improvised meditation on brotherhood and reclaiming the dead The beautiful sometimes large-scale, richly atmospheric 35 mm landscape images, nice soundtrack and Catalan-language narration are enchanting as a mood piece, if one is content with a trajectory that hasn't much momentum and doesn't lead anywhere in particular Filmmaker Marc Recha and his non-identical twin David are the stars and the narrative is voiced by their younger sister Marc had been researching the life of Ramon Barnils (1940-2001), a socialist editor who had been a family friend He felt he was saturated with information and had to take a break The break turned into making this film, which seeks to capture the mood of the interviews with Barnils' associates, thoughts about the Spanish Civil War, the drought season they were experiencing, the rugged landscape, the Recha brothers' affection for each other, swims and suntanned nudity and whatever characters or stories they ran into as they camped out of their van This leads to pursuit of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers In the end David has to go back to Barcelona to be with his daughter and Marc has to return to his project, and there it ends I found it fascinating to listen to an extended narration in the Catalan language with its blend of Spanish and French-sounding words (perhaps linked with ProvenÌ¤al) This isn't a major film but it commands attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clean visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing around with genres and blending autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh and thought-provoking wayAn official selection of the 2006 New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center\n",
            "A CRY IN THE DARK A CRY IN THE DARK was a film that I anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid, if unremarkable film This assumption came from the fact that aside from Streep's Best Actress nomination, the movie received little attention from major awards groupsLittle did I anticipate that A CRY IN THE DARK would be such a riveting drama, well-constructed on every level If you ask me, this is an under-appreciatted classicThe film opens rather slowly, letting the audience settle into the Chamberlain's at a relaxed pace and really notice that, at the core, they are an incredibly loving, simple family Fred Schepisi (the director) selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy, while also showing the attentive bliss with which Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain care for their childrenWhile the famous line \"A Dingo Took My Baby!\" has become somewhat of a punchline these days, the movie never even comes close to laughable The actual death of Azaria is horrifyingly captured It is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience horrified and asking questionsThe majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the Chamberlain's continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court, which suspects Lindy of murderThe fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping As an audience member, I was fully invested in the Chamberlain's plight and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media But at the same, the media/public opinion is understandable I loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic, but they always had valid reasons to hold their viewsThe final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramasIn terms of performances, the only ones that really matter in this film are those of Streep and Neill and they deliver in every way For me, this ranks as one of (if not #1) Meryl Streep's best performances For all her mastery of different accents (which of course are very impressive in their own right), Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters I find this to be one of Streep's more subtle performances, and she hits it out of the park And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streep's performance From what I've seen, this is undoubtedly Neill's finest work to date It's a shame he wasn't recognized by the Academy with a Leading Actor nomination to match Streep's b/c the two of them play of each other brilliantlyMore emotionally gripping than most films, and also incredibly suspenseful A CRY IN THE DARK far exceeded my expectations I highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where Meryl screams \"The dingo took my baby!\" watch the film and see just how much more there is to A CRY IN THE DARK then that one line A \n",

            "Nothing revolutionary here; just impeccably elegant, restrained cinemaGARDE A VUE is confined almost exclusively to a drab police station, and mostly to one interrogation room, but director Claude Miller (who made the wonderful film THIS SWEET SICKNESS, among others) intercalates spare glimpses of exterior tableaux as minimalist locale scenography Miller's restraint, especially early on, is breathtaking, and his exquisite handling of the consequently-pivotal interior mise-en-scene makes for captivating viewingLino Ventura is superb as usual, succeeding to legitimize a character that, on paper, is cliche: the laconic, hard-nosed, world-weary homicide detective Ventura lives the role, making it completely believable, even though the script allows us little access to his inner workings; the film ends at the very moment it appears he will be forced to confront his failure for the first timeMichel Serrault is equal to the task as the suspected child-killer who shrewdly spars with the single-minded flic The exchanges between the two are more-often-than-not pregnant with tension and the aura of a constantly metamorphosing playing field for a battle of wits Serrault's character is by turns deplorably haughty and cunning, and pitiable; then laterThe \"message\" of GARDE A VUE, if one were to search for one, is a condemnation of police methodology and the kind of pressures that make a cop over-zealous to, if necessary, close cases at the expense of justice For most of its length though the film shines as nothing more than an exemplar of how to turn a potentially soporific set-bound scenario into a suspenseful drama of the utmost cinematic economy\n",

            "Audiences today will probably watch a film like Ossessione and not really consider how unprecedented it was during the time when it came out The structure of the film really divorces from sap-happy Hollywood conventionsåÑas well as other major theatrical elements It relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light Films of this natureåÑthe neo-realist filmsåÑwere made to reflect the darkness felt during post-World War II times Ossessione tackles some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war, including: adultery, conspiracy, murder, pregnancy, etc Aside from the one crane shot and certain musical swelling moments, the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty: shot on-location, uses natural lighting and most likely non-popular actors All of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film, yielding the following theme: Negative karmic repercussions will haunt those who deliberately act immorallyThe two leadsåÑGino and GiovannaåÑare polar opposites, yet both carry the mentality: we're bored and we want to be entertained Gino is a drifter; a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations Giovanna is a bored house-wife cemented in the familiarly of marital permanence: she doesn't want to leave her home and husband, but would rather remain where she is because it's safer Gino's lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle Giovanna craves; the only difference is that she's too afraid to live it herselfåÑthat's why she falls in love with Gino: he represents everything she wants but doesn't have the courage to get She wants to live in a world free from the monotony of living with her corpulent husbandåÑGino is the perfect ticket into that world The affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the 40's feeling somewhat uneasy I mean, films prior to the neo-realist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before To say the least it was probably a bit alarmingIn conjunction with the theme, the neo-realist style helps show the negative repercussions of adulterous behavior Succinctly put, adulterous behavior (as shown in the film) leads to depressing and ultimately deadened lives When Gino and Giovanna conspire with each other to \"eliminate\" Giovanna's husband, karma comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done They return to their home: the atmosphere is dark and biting (as can be expected from the neo-realist style) They are not happy; they're actually more depressed They thought that by eliminating Giovanna's husband that they'd live happier lives, but they were duped The film ends with Giovanna's deathåÑit being in karmic similitude of her husband's death I think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons Here's whyThere's a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen, and if so, to what extent I think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being glorified, but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have As the subtext of Ossessione asks, is adultery and murder evil I think the film eagerly responds yes! The adulterous behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are Ironically though, towards the end of the film when they seem to be healed of their depression and are seen basking in each other's arms inside the car, the author of the film shows that their happiness is, in fact, a faÌ¤ade: the car crashes off the cliff and into the river, killing Giovanna; the police arrest Gino I think it was the author's intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior, in the end karma will come back to haunt them I agree I think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly selfishåÑalways wanting instant gratification and not willing to endure through hard times This was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that Gino and Giovanna experience in their relationship: he can't handle the pressure of living in Giovanna's husband shadow, so he leaves Giovanna and sleeps with another girl Such is typical of the insatiable, hedonistic personalityAll in all, the film seemed very risky for its time The audience, however, was prepared to see such a film because of the sobriety the war brought Those pre-war, happy-go-lucky films were no longer being believed Movie-going audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters: they wanted to see characters whose lives were entangled in so-called 'sin' because it was a reflection of their own life problems Ossessione, then, acts as a great catalyst for where the future of film was heading That is, a lot of the naturalism pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neo-realist film movement\n",

It's similar to films like Joy Ride, Duel, Jeepers Creepers, etc, etc and it has some suspenseful moments here and there, plus The gore effects are really well done for the most part This is a surprisingly great low budget Horror/Comedy, it's funny and pretty well made, with good performances and a really cool twist ending, I highly recommend this one!

Justin Urich is excellent as the ass of a Best Friend, however I just couldn't help but love him as he was very funny, and often stole a lot of the scenes, I really dug him! Aimee Brooks is gorgeous, and did great with what she had to do, she had good chemistry with Jungmann and like Jungmann was especially good at the end, as I loved her mysterious character Michael Bailey Smith is wonderful as The Monster Man he was very creepy looking, had some awesome makeup, and is now one of my favorite slashers!

            "This movie is by far one of the worst B-movies I have ever seen There are no plot twists at all Though the acting is decent, the storyline is terrible There are also many mistakes in the movie, and it was bothersome to watch For any of you who like horror movies, slasher movies, or even B-movies, I don't recommend this to anyone at all Most of the movie is focused on pointless killing, in ways that aren't even worth discussing This movie could very well be compared to a crappy remake of Jeepers Creepers, which, too, wasn't that great of a movie For anyone who wishes to spend a day at home, watching poorly made movies, this one takes the cake\n",

No thanks, there are plenty of other shows that involve devious characters (Phil of the Future's Pim for example) where the evil one doesn't win or if they do not in the way they thoughNot to mention that I think this is a terrible picture to paint about living with step-siblings Yes life isn't rosy but one could attempt to portray a character that wasn't outright evil and winsMy suggestion is that you watch this only if you like seeing the villain win\n",
            "This review may contain some SPOILERSJust when you thought they didn't make them so extremely bad anymore, along comes Rae Dawn Chong as a space vixen and Willie Nelson as a Native American witchdoctor! It's even worse when you factor in that these two are the BETTER aspects of `Starlight,' a film that should only be viewed for laughsChong is an alien sent to Earth to seek out the only remaining half-breed, part man and part alien Apparently, the Earth is in dire straits Something is wrong with the genetics of mankind, and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland Only by duplicating the DNA of the half-breed can the kindly alien race save the planet Don't ask me how that is, since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution, which is caused by humans You would think Earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures, not saving them! Anyway, the half-breed turns out to be Billy Wirth, a man living in a small Southwestern town and is part Native American from his mother's line, despite the fact that his mother is a red-headed Caucasian and his grandfather is Willie Nelson Wasn't this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic Carmen Electra bomb `The Chosen One' such a howler Chong arrives in her ship just as Wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend Before you can say utter the word `hogwash,' Chong is revealing her secret to Wirth, who isn't surprised for a moment, and spreading the word to Wirth's family Chong also makes pals with Wirth's mother, who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years Well, this is because Wirth's father was an alien that abandoned her Of course, he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to Earth for Wirth so he can use Wirth's DNA to make the people of Earth his slaves (Huh) His laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture Wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie Not only are they boring, but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the mostThe ideas might be nice on paper, but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity, particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien But the effects are the bane of the movie The opening scene involves Chong on her spaceship, communicating with her superior, someone who we do not see but that Chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light They use no spoken words, but telepathy, so we are treated to subtitles Trouble is, both Chong and her superior's subtitles both look alike, and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually `speaking' at any given moment, which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish The spaceship is the worst effect to come out of Hollywood this side of an Ed Wood film Now, I am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this, but these effects really got to me The most offensive was the most simple one: a fake night sky The stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone Most notably are the moments where Chong tells someone she comes from Pleiades, and we get a shot of the seven stars Thing is, the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie, but any stargazer knows that Pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations Perseus and Taurus, and the cluster doesn't take up much room in the sky at all These effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment Be careful, for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have Willie Nelson turn into a human spotlight and    Oh, it has to be seen to be believed!Starlight, star bright; Last star I see tonight; I wish I might, I wish I may; not have to watch any more of this trash todayZantara's score: 1 out of 10\n",

            "My Take: Typically routine and lazy straight to video attempt from Disney Disney must have fallen in love with the family movie tradition that is the family dog Many movies have devoted themselves with stories that solely center themselves with man's best friend Disney themselves have made a handful They also made a handful of those that are literally dogs Add this one to that bunchI haven't seen the original for a very long time, so probably I'm not the right person to judge if this straight-to-video sequel fares any better Anyone above the age of seven aren't the right people to see it either Perhaps only the youngest of the young will want to see LADY AND THE TRAMP II: SCAMP'S ADVENTURE, and even they would grow up and say it wasn't the best kind of family entertainment they have ever seen I guess to be fair, I can say is that it warrants a rental, but that ain't much to sayThis sequel pretty much picks up the parts left behind after the original oft-called classic Lady and Tramp now have a litter of cute Crocker Spaniel pups and one mischievous mongrel named Scamp who is a chip off the old block Instead of the confines of home, Scamp wishes to run off with the other junkyard dogs of town, unknown of his dad's own past as one of those mongrels of the streets To capture the charms of the original, this one throws in the same poor dog/rich dog love story, in vice-versa Scamp falls for a one of the junkyard dogs named Angel (and who wouldn't with a name like that and a voice that sounds like Alyssa Milano) Que replay of the famous spaghetti scene!

            "As a big fan of Brian Yuzna and the majority of the movies he's been involved in, I guessed I'd enjoy Progeny I didn't, although in ways it has it's moments However, if you're expecting something of the calibre of Society or Beyond ReAnimator, you could be in for a shock In a way this is similar to Society, being a tale of a seemingly ordinary world with a horrific supernatural underbellybut that's where it endsI'm not covering for Yuzna when I say that the fault doesn't really lie with him, as bad direction is bad direction, but the direction is sound What trips the movie up is both script and acting Stuart Gordon (ReAnimator, Dagon) has written an intelligent script, but one that doesn't really work with Yuzna's style of direction, leaving him paused on actors delivering lengthy dialogue when really he wants to throw that camera around and get down with his bad self This matter makes the movie awkward enough as it is, but there's worseIf the movie had been made with great actors, the movie would have probably held it's own Unfortunately this is very far from the case The acting is wooden, shockingly so even for a low-budget B feature The inexplicably successful and renowned Arnold Vosloo wrecks every damn line with near pinpoint precision, handing in one of the worst performances I've seen in a long while The man manages to turn every line of well considered dialogue into the kind of ham-line you'll be throwing drunkenly at mates next time you're in the pub 'Hey Bob! GOOD GOD, AM I GOING MAD! WHAT'SCOME OVER ME! NOOOO!' In fact I may try that one myself next weekend The last minute addition of genre veteran (and personal favourite) Brad Dourif, instead of enriching the film like it should, almost seems to hand Dourif the movie in a last ditch effort to stop Vosloo from hamming, but quite frankly Dourif looks deeply uncomfortable (possibly waiting for the next assault of bad acting) next to Vosloo, and even an eccentric turn from him fails to resuscitate the filmIf the acting was better, this movie would have been okay Hell, it might have been pretty enjoyable, but the lack of character makes the movie a soulless affair, and makes the horror element seem tacked on and tasteless instead of an organic part of the film I found the alien torture/rape scenes a little difficult to stomach already, but the fact that the characters were so lacking made them seem gratuitous as well as unpleasant, leaving a nasty taste in the mouthSo, if you really like Sci-fi and don't have a problem with bad acting, pedestrian pacing and a really garish, nasty rape scene, Progeny will probably be your cup of tea But since I do, I'm probably never going to watch it again Once was enough On the plus side, this is the only Sci-Fi movie Yuzna ever bothered to make, so he obviously wasn't really that pleased with it himself\n",
            "From the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful 'Cruel Intentions', and how flat it landed You'll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting Robin Dunne as Valmont Then in the second scene, you meet the two best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother That is, if you can get past the fact that Kathryn wasn't blonde in the first film Then the movie goes on, you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago, and you notice Sebastian has already met an Anette in the past, here called Danielle, and a Cecile, here called Cherie How original is that for a prequel Then it turns into a low budget 'Wild Things' type of film with lots and lots of oh-my \"twists\" As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice Not that he is a bad actor, he's good He just doesn't have the charisma Ryan did Amy Adams, who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time, once again delivers But with all the talent in the world, there is no way one could save this trash As a whole, this \"movie\" feels like a 'Beverly Hills, 90210' episode The score has been stolen from 'Cruel Intentions' and 'Jawbreaker' Yes, they used the score from JAWBREAKER Couldn't they at least leave that one alone!

            "A plane carrying employees of a large biotech firm--including the CEO's daughter--goes down in thick forest in the Pacific Northwest When the search and rescue mission is called off, the CEO, Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission But just what is Knowles searching for and trying to rescue, and just what is following and watching them in the woods Oy, what a mess this film was! It was a shame, because for one, it stars Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favorite modern genre actors, and two, it could have easily been a decent film It suffers from two major flaws, and they're probably both writer/director Jonas Quastel's fault--this film (which I'll be calling by its aka of Sasquatch) has just about the worst editing I've ever seen next to Alone in the Dark (2005), and Quastel's constant advice for the cast appears to have been, \"Okay, let's try that again, but this time I want everyone to talk on top of each other, improvise non-sequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possible\"The potential was there Despite the rip-off aspects (any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib The Blair Witch Project (1999) and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing Predator (1987)), Ed Wood-like exposition and ridiculous dialogue, the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts The monster costume, once we actually get to see it, was more than sufficient for my tastes The mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if Quastel and fellow writer Chris Lanning would have turned down the stereotype notch from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships The monster's \"lair\" had some nice production design, specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001) If it had been edited well, there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effectiveBut the most frightening thing about Sasquatch is the number of missteps made: For some reason, Quastel thinks it's a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene A, then a few lines of scene B, then back to A, back to B, and so onFor some reason, he thinks it's a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue, whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anywayFor some reason, he doesn't care whether scenes were shot during the morning, afternoon, middle of the night, etc He just cuts to them at random For that matter, the scenes we're shown appear to be selected at random Important events either never or barely appear, and we're stuck with far too many pointless scenesFor some reason, he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there, or it needs to just be cut out, because it's not that important (the monster's intelligence and \"humanity\" could have easily been shown in another way)For some reason, there is a whole character--Mary Mancini--left in the script even though she's superfluousFor some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft-core porno scene, even though the motif is never repeated againFor some reason, characters keep calling Harlan Knowles \"Mr H\", like they're stereotypes of Asian domesticsFor some reason, Quastel insists on using the \"Blurry Cam\" and \"Distorto-Cam\" for the monster attack scenes, even though the costume doesn't look that bad, and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog, a subtle filter, or anything else other than bad cinematographyI could go on, but you get the ideaI really wanted to like this film better than I didåÑI'm a Henriksen fan, I'm intrigued by the subject, I loved the setting, I love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one level--but I just couldn't Every time I thought it was \"going to be better from this point until the end\", Quastel made some other awful move In the end, my score was a 3 out of 10\n",

            "I used to watch this on either HBO or Showtime or Cinemax during the one summer in the mid 90's that my parents subscribed to those channels I came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark, bizarre and fascinating I was young then, in my early teens; and now years later after having discovered the great Arliss Howard and being blown away by \"Big Bad Love\" I bought the DVD of \"Wilder Napalm\" and re-watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years I absolutely loved it! I was really impressed and affected by it There are so many dynamic fluid complexities and cleverness within the camera movements and cinematography; all of which perfectly gel with the intelligent, intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads, their story, the music and all the other actors as well It's truly \"Cinematic\" I love Arliss Howard's subtle intensity, ambivalent strength and hidden intelligence, I'm a big fan of anything he does; and his interplay with Debra Winger's manic glee (they are of course married) has that magic charming reality to it that goes past the camera (I wonder if they watch this on wedding anniversaries\"Big Bad Love\" should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it; it's brilliant) And, Dennis Quaid in full clown make-up, sneakily introduced, angled, hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you don't see very often Quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways, with that huge slit mouth span, hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness (here as both) Both Howard and Quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal gunslinger square-offs in darkly cool fashion In fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity It's really a fantastic film, put together by intelligence, imagination, agility and chemistry by all parties involved I really cannot imagine how this got funded, and it looks pretty expensive to me, by such a conventional, imagination-less system, but I thank God films like this slip through the system every once in awhile In a great way, with all of its day-glo bright carnival colors, hip intelligence, darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time: \"Grosse Pointe Blank\"now that's a compliment in my book!\n",

Rent this one for a good time, maybe grab a few friends and a pizza you'll have a good time7/10On a side note, the soundtrack is spectacular It's great to hear the far under appreciated Paolo Conte used, and it left me humming snippets of the score long after the credits rolled\n",

            "Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands, trying to make sense of what he's just done Meanwhile, a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agency's response to what's just happened on screen An American flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot, but as he speaks, it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory, as if it doesn't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national securityThis shot effectively captures the mood of the film As well as portraying Bourne's quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and securityIt is also probably the best film you'll see in the cinema this year It's just so intense Bourne says to Simon Ross (Considine) \"This isn't some newspaper story, this is real\" and in the audience you almost believe him The camera shakes, but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying, instead of just being actors performing well-written roles The action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazingThe pacing is just incredible It keeps driving forward towards its conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece While they're often simple (the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone) they're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by itWith its intense action set-pieces, brilliantly paced storyline, and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security, the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age Ultimatum is its peak\n",
            "This is one of the best crime-drama movies during the late 1990s It was filled with a great cast, a powerful storyline, and many of the players involved gave great performances Pacino was great; he should have been nominated for something John Cusack was good too, as long as the viewer doesn't mind his Louuu-siana accent He may come off as annoying if you can't stand this dialect The way that Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was believable, dramatic, and slightly comical at times Danny Aiello was superb as always David Paymer was great in a supporting role Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable There were times when this picture mentioned so many characters, probably too many It may take a second viewing to remember, \"which Zapatti was which\" After so many cross-references, one has to stop and think just to recap The ending didn't have a lot of sting It was built up for so long and then was a bit of a letdown This was one of the few problems with the film Since the movie wasn't billed as a \"huge, blockbuster\" big screen hit, it made some forget that this movie even existed Pacino and Aiello were great but the film's lack of \"splash\" in the theaters may have accounted for no nominations It was semi-successful in the home market, and viewers are still learning that this title is out there Made in 1996, it still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to comeSo, make yourself some lemon pudding (you'll see) and see this movie!\n",

There are movies which I have not watched! Thus, I must watch them immediatelyThe first five minutes of these series were acceptable In fact, I quite enjoyed the variation of the reason for the denunciation, however different it had seemed It went all downhill from there, though Chauvelin was too foppish And, I daresay, too old for this role Not nearly that dark and dashing figure with his dreadful either-or (And what was that with random bed scene featuring him It was way too creepy - wasn't his only love the Madame Guillotine, and his only interest - his job, and his only obsession - Sir Percy) Marguerite Prettiest woman in France Cleverest woman in Europe I think not Although, whatever compelled her to break into the study of Sir Percy I haven't the faintest idea And whatever my Lord Tony has done to deserve this death Yes, every member of the League did pledge his life to Sir Percy, but he would have never endangered any of them nor would have run away like a coward when his dear friend faces mortal danger And if by any means he had to mourn his companion, he would have done that, mourn, not just move on as if nothing had happened Which brings me to another point, Sir Percy His portrayal was most dreadful He was neither a lazy fop, nor a gallant and elusive hero who is a master of transformations Nor did he care too much about cravats (his pronunciation of that word alone made my ears bleed) And with his own hands he had never killed anyone So what was that with him randomly walking around and slaughtering peopleThe costumes were just too flashy for that time period as well This is post-revolutionary France we are talking about! Not pre-revolutionary People in dresses like that stand out in a crowd quite easily It was all just gah!Although, I must admit, after I watched other parts my opinion did change slightly Watching it as a separate work, independent of Scarlet Pimpernel series, it was tolerable Just your other average hero in the mask But for what they tried to pass it, it is still miserable\n",

            "Speed which I believe is direct copy of the Hollywood movie Cellular (I haven't watched this one) gives an impression of a test match which is very exciting in first four days, but then gets in a very boring draw at the end I have watched this movie today on 12th January 2008 on rented VCD It's release date is 19th Oct 2007 But still fortunately for me I didn't know or heard much of this movie before except that it is a flop at box office So in this situation when I watch the movie, I feel that this movie could have been a very good movie, but then the director again falls in the trap for Bollywood traditions and has wasted a very good chanceOff course as a Bhatt movie it must be copied from somewhere else But now days it doesn't matter for me, if I haven't seen the original movie I just found the main theme much similar to 'Nick of Time' and 'Badshah' In the movie Sanjay Suri is shown an intelligence agent, but his wife thinks that he is a chef This brings back the memory of 'True-Lies' The only new part was the use if the phone But that too I found out now is taken from movie Cellular So when a movie is made with the mixture of so many other movies it's future is quite clearThe things I like about the movie is its pace As the name suggest the things really happens fast, and there is not much time to think about in between the scenes But this breaks in the last 20 minutes of so where the movie goes in traditional Bollywood style of Dhishum dhishumThe plot of the movie is also quite interesting Three stories going parallel, one after the other One of the kidnapping of Urmila, the other of the Zayed trying to help Urmila, and then the plan of murder of prime minister These three stories gets mixed up naturally with each other as the movie continuesBut then the very ordinary acting and unnecessary extra style has killed the spirit of the movie Except Sanjay Suri, none other makes any impression This goes even for Urmila, who is always promising in RGVs movies Due to this ordinary acting some scenes doesn't really convey the feelings that director wanted Eg the scene at the end where Urmila leaves all hope and cut the phone, should have made a good impact But instead we just wait for the end of that sceneOther than acting, some unnecessary love for style demoralizes the movie Showing so cool villains is good for Hollywood movies not for Bollywood The background of London is also only for making style and not much intelligent advantage of this background can be seen Especially at the end, all those dhishhum- dhishhum were utterly unnecessary May be director has an impression that the climax in Hindi movies must have such fights They look unrealistic, increase the length of the movie and make sure that the people are leaving theater before the movie endsOver and all, I find the movie once watchable If it is coming on TV or you can get it on rent its OK But then again make sure that you have the remote and forward button handy Next time, when the movie is on TV, you can safely watch other channels\n",

            "Why do I like DISORGANIZED CRIME so much Why do I chuckle or laugh out loud any time I think of a dozen or more scenes from this movie It's kind of hard to explain, but I'll give it a try First of all, it's very funny indeed - in contrast to what lots of \"official\" reviews want you to believe But then again, that depends entirely on your sense of humour, so there is no sense in arguing about that Often the humour is in the dialogue, and often it is situational comedy There is for instance this very hilarious scene in which the 4 gang members have been given a lift in the back of a truck When the farmer drops them, they just stand there by the road, covered all over with cow s or whatever They are totally unnerved; then, realizing the humour of the scene, they one by one start laughing about themselves, and Ruben Blades (as Carlos), looking (and certainly smelling) terrible, nonchalantly takes out some mouth spray to at least do something about his breath (simply describing the scene here makes me chuckle again!) Which leads to the second point: the acting Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ, Ruben Blades and Corbin Bernsen (okay, the latter overdoes it a bit at times) all fit and play their parts beautifully - in fact, you get the feeling they must have been enjoying themselves too when shooting the film Thirdly, there is the plot  Jim Kouf, the director and screenwriter, is very laid-back; he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves More often than not, there is no real action, and yet you enjoy these 4 very different people - who attempt to rob a bank although their boss (Bernsen) does not seem to turn up - grumble about each other and even-tually, grudgingly, like each other The movie is a fantastic parody of the typical bank robbery plot - totally impossible with all its twists and coincidences, yet utterly convincing in its love for ironic details Incidentally, the title of the film is one of the best I have ever come across, because it per-fectly summarizes the plot in a very ironic way Therefore, take my advice: watch this film, but if you don't chuckle, grin or smile during the first 10 minutes, forget it - it's not your type of film PS The only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay - if you happen to know how, do tell me\n",

            "\"Murder Over New York\" is an entertaining entry in the Charlie Chan series of films, but if you're paying attention, a lot of plot holes reveal themselves to the observant eye While traveling to New York City for an annual police convention, Chan (Sidney Toler) meets former Scotland Yard investigator Hugh Drake (Frederick Worlock) on the same flight Now employed by military intelligence, Drake is tracking Paul Narvo and his Hindu servant, suspected for acts of sabotage around the world Drake believes that by contacting Narvo's elusive wife, he'll be able to pin down the whereabouts of the master criminalWhen Drake winds up dead in the library of George Kirby, president of the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation, Charlie theorizes that he was killed by a recently discovered poisonous gas called \"tetrogene\", administered via a glass pellet that releases the poison when broken Summoning Kirby to bring all of his dinner party guests together, Chan and Police Inspector Vance (Donald MacBride) question those in attendance, as one of them may be the killer Among them are Herbert Fenton (Melville Cooper), a fellow Oxford student of Drake's, actress June Preston (Joan Valerie), unknown to Drake but requested by him to attend, Ralph Percy (Kane Richmond), the chief designer at Kirby's aircraft company, and Keith Jeffrey (John Sutton), Kirby's stock broker Kirby butler Boggs (Leyland Hodgson) is also a suspect, especially after Number #2 Son Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) catches him steaming open a cablegram, the contents of which concern Boggs himselfThere are some other cleverly planted characters in the proceedings as well Mrs Narvo turns up as Patricia West (Marjorie Weaver), and contrary to Drake's suspicion that she might lead him to Narvo, is actually on the run away from her former husband and a disastrous marriage She's involved with David Elliott (Robert Lowery), principal of a chemical research firm, and thereby a suspect in the tetrogene angleAs with many Chan films, racial comments must be taken in stride with the proceedings This one offers two glaring ones When Kirby's black servant is brought in for questioning, he states that he doesn't know anything about Drake's murder, that he's completely \"in the dark\" Chan's response: \"Condition appear contagious\"Later, following Inspector Vance's order to round up all the Hindu's in New York, Jimmy Chan comments on their arrival with \"They're all beginning to look alike to me\" Actually, the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the movie, as Shemp Howard impersonates Hindu mystic \"The Great Rashid\", but is actually uncovered by the police to be con artist Shorty McCoyBefore the movie's over, two more victims fall to the clever Narvo - his confederate Ramullah, and aircraft magnate Kirby himself To uncover the killer, Chan, in concert with Elliott, arranges for a test flight aboard a newly developed TR4 Bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule planted by mechanics on the plane the day before Before it can release it's deadly poison, the Brit Fenton catches the falling capsule in mid-air, revealing that he knew about the plant Arrested and brought in for questioning, Chan asserts that Fenton is not Narvo The real Narvo reveals himself when he offers a poisoned cup of water to the nervous Fenton, anxious to maintain Narvo's secret But Chan was clever enough to be wary of such an attempt, and reveals the real murderer - Narvo now in the guise of stock broker Jeffrey, having undergone reconstructive surgery following a car accidentNow for the plot holes When first investigating Hugh Drake's murder, it was maintained by the police that fingerprints found in the library did not match those of any of the dinner guests However Jeffrey/Narvo was present at the dinner party It had already been established that Drake had one non party visitor in the library, chemist Elliott If the fingerprints really did not belong to Narvo, then making them an issue was pointlessAlso, at the end of the film when Narvo offers Fenton the poisoned water, how did he think he would get away with it with everyone there as a witness But going even one better than that, how would a world traveling saboteur like Narvo have the time and wherewithal to establish himself as a New York City stockbroker, it just doesn't make sense For trivia fans, a few more points bear mentioning In the film, Number #2 Son Jimmy is a college student studying chemistry as he comes to \"Pop's\" aid to solve the case In the prior Chan film - \"Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum\" - Jimmy was a law studentThe poison gas formula would get reworked in a later Chan film, this time by Monogram with Roland Winters in the Chan role in \"Docks of New Orleans\" In that story, poison gas is released from shattered radio tubes in similar fashion to claim its' victims\n",

            "Mention Bollywood to anyone with a slight familiarity with the genre and the images usually conjured up are of tacky, over the top musical numbers peopled with costuming that makes Vegas seem a bastion of conservatism This perception is not helped by the whiff of condescension that permeates most movies that have approached Bollywood from an outsider's perspective Willard Carroll's romantic comedy Marigold, however takes a different tack It is not a nudge-nudge wink-wink look at those silly people and their clueless antics but a sincere appreciation of Bollywood for its vitality, its lack of irony and self-consciousnessIt is obvious that the director has a tremendous affection and respect for Bollywood while at the same time is bemused by its kitschier aspects And if you have a familiarity with Bollywood, you can appreciate what he does here in making a true hybrid of Bollywood and Hollywood movie conventions From one of the opening shots, a flashback of the Salman character as a child by the sea, talking with his grandmother (played by Helen! - how many Salman movies start with this same premise) to the flashback sequence that is incorporated into the movie that Marigold and Prem has been filming, anyone who has seen enough Bollywood movies will recognize these references The story itself incorporates tried and true conventions from both Hollywood and Bollywood as well åÐ the fish out of water meets duty-to-one's-family-at the expense of personal fulfillment The structure of the film follows the typical Bollywood plot line of the more comical set up of the first half giving way to a more dramatic resolution of the second Yet ultimately the sensibility of the film is that of Hollywood, with its understated, wry humor and its story of a woman learning to believe in herself, to reach self-affirmationYou couldn't have a movie inspired by Bollywood if there weren't any musical numbers and this movie does not disappoint with seven of them Unlike Bollywood, however, the songs do not pop out of nowhere and transport its characters to a European locale or Goan beach; they exist as musical numbers that are part of the film that is being made, reminiscent of how musical numbers were justified in Busby Berkeley movies as being part of a stage show Or they come out of a situation where music already has a reason to be there åÐ a sexy nightclub scene where Prem teaches Marigold to dance or a beach scene where there are musicians (including a cameo from the playback singer Shaan) performing All reflect the emotional state of the protagonists at that point in the movie Often the music will take a conventional song from one genre and put a twist on it from the other So in one of the highlights of the film where Marigold comes into her own, the song picturazation is fairly typical of its genre åÐ the female star singing and dancing among a line of women åÐ but in this case it's blond Ali Larter looking like a total natural Bollywood film star, emoting and lip synching to the Hindi lyrics with no subtitlesAlso synonymous with Bollywood are sumptuous visuals and Marigold fulfills that aspect beautifully thanks to some of the top talent working in Bollywood today The cinematographer is Anil Mehta who was also the cinematographer for Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam The choreographer is Vaibhavi Merchant and production designer is Nitin Desai, both from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas You can really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam on this film åÐ in fact, the illuminated floor in one of the numbers was originally from Dholi Taro Dhol, which coincidentally has an embedded Marigold patternAs for the cast, Carroll obviously has a penchant for spotting acting talent as evidenced by Playing by Heart åÐ one of the first movies for both Angelina Jolie and Ryanne Phillippe And in this film he again hits the mark with Ali Larter One of the main reasons the film works is because of Larter She makes a bitchy, unappealing character sympathetic and her subsequent transformation believable and she is smart, funny, and sexy because she is smart and funny She and Salman share excellent chemistry and that is one of the film's biggest strengthsSalman Khan plays the role of Prince Charming here as filtered through his iconic role as Prem This is old school Prem, however, so expect a quiet, subdued Salman - those used to him in his usual stripping avatar may be disappointed åÐ or relieved!

            "Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung-Fu movies which Shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of Hollywood, and the protagonist Gordon Liu, the counterpart to the western's Clint Eastwood Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest, this is \"Presented in Shaw Scope\", just like the good old daysThis film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that eraAct One sets up the premise Workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot, having their wages cut by 20% by incoming manchu gangsters They can't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters, and their boss At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many timesAct Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob However, without real martial arts, he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple, to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly After some slapstick moments, he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!) but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like Mr Miyagi's style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple Nothing can keep a good man down, and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox wayAct Three is where the fight fest begins With cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow, with some pause in between moves, but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used ad-nausem in Hollywood flicks, they sure don't make fight scenes like they used to!

It's true that this movie, little flaws apart, does not pander to the average audiences, but those interested in watching an excellent (while, again, not beyond criticism) movie of the incomparable director who gave us \"The Shop on the Main Street\" (the best movie ever about Holocaust) should not miss this just because some silly IMDb rating system decides that \"American Beauty\" is better than \"The Angel Levine\"It isn't\n",

            "By 1950, John Ford had already fully-developed the ideas and motifs that would form the core of his most successful Westerns Always present, for example, is a strong sense of community, most poignantly captured in the Joad family of Steinbeck's 'The Grapes of Wrath (1940)' Within these communities, even amid Ford's loftier themes of racism and the pioneer spirit, there's always room for the smaller human interactions, the minor friendships and romances that make life worth living 'Wagon Master (1950)' came after Ford had released the first two films in his \"cavalry\" trilogy åÐ 'Fort Apache (1948)' and 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949)' åÐ and it covers similar territory, only without the military perspective and, more damningly, the strong lead of John Wayne Ben Johnson and Harry Cary, Jr are fine actors, but they feel as though they should be playing second-fiddle to somebody, and Ward Bond's cursing Mormon elder, while potentially a candidate for such a role, isn't given quite enough focus to satisfactorily fit the billIn 'Wagon Master,' Ford seems so comfortable with his tried-and-tested Western formula that any character development is largely glossed over Ben Johnson's romance with Joanne Dru is treated as an obligation more than anything else, and Harry Cary Jr's charming of a Mormon girl is so perfunctory as to be almost nonexistent in the final film, leaving one to ponder the survival of deleted scenes Only in Charles Kemper's charismatic and shamelessly-villainous Uncle Shiloh does Ford try some different, and it works, even with his being surrounded by a troop of insufferably hammy slack-jawed yokels Where Ford does succeed is in orchestrating the conglomeration of three distinct races of Americans åÐ the values-orientated Mormoms, the easygoing horse-traders, the eccentric travelling showmen åÐ into a cohesive community of pioneers looking towards a bright future This apparent harmony is thrown into disarray by the arrival of Uncle Shiloh's gun-toting outlaws, who exploit the lawlessness of the Western frontier but ultimately lose out to the noble cowboys who \"only ever drew on snakes\"Ford reportedly considered Wagon Master among the favourite of his films, and perhaps this has something to do with the absence of big names like John Wayne or Henry Fonda Armed only with his stock selection of usual players, Ford is able to generate a sense of community by avoiding placing focus on any one character, though most of the Mormom travellers still remain completely anonymous Despite being undoubtedly well-made, I can't help feeling that this film only does well what other Ford pictures did even better: the terrific majesty of the the Western frontier was presented more beautifully in 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'; the romances and friendly squabbles among community members took greater prominence in 'Fort Apache'; the early relations with Native Americans, only hinted at here, were more thoroughly examined in 'The Searchers (1956)'; the bold pioneering spirit of the early settlers was explored more movingly (albeit by Henry Hathaway and George Marshall) in 'How the West Was Won (1962)' 'Wagon Master' is pure John Ford, but it isn't a landmark\n",

            "The thirties horror films that are best remembered are always the likes of Dracula and Frankenstein; and there's a very good reason for that, but there were a number of smaller but nevertheless excellent productions, and The Invisible Ray is certainly one of them The plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen many times before (even way back in 1936) but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director Lambert Hillyer has created a very nifty little original horror film The plot focuses on the good hearted Dr Janos Rukh; a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the Earth His discovery leads him to believe that there may be an unknown radioactive element somewhere in Africa and so he sets off along with a team of esteemed colleagues to find it However, tragedy strikes while on the expedition and the good doctor ends up becoming exposed to the element; which makes him glow in the dark, and also sends him madThe biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly the fact that it stars the two biggest horror stars of its day - Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, and both give excellent performances Karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has plenty of meat for Karloff to impress with Bela Lugosi has a role which is extremely different from what we're used to seeing him in, and it's a great performance from him also; it's nice to see a bit of versatility from Lugosi The film does get off to a rather slow start; but things soon start to pick up The second half of the film is the best and that's really when the film gets exciting and Karloff gets a chance to shine (literally) The film does not put its focus on big special effects and largely relies on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting; and it does work very well The film remains interesting throughout and boils down to a very decent climax that wraps everything up nicely Overall, The Invisible Ray may not be one of the very best horror films of the thirties; but it's a very good one and comes recommended\n",

            "From actor and independent writer/director John Cassavetes, A Woman Under the Influence gives the viewer a look at a working class family with a problem of mental instability The husband, Nick (played by Peter Falk) is a blue collar worker who has trouble showing his wife, Mabel (played by Gena Rowlands) the amount of attention that she deserves From the onset of the film, it is obvious that Mabel is very quirky and strange, but only a few minutes later it is clear that she is much more than that Crazy Bonkers Out of her damn mind Nick tries his hardest to hide this from his co-workers, and after she has a particularly strange incident at dinner, he asks her if she'll be okay, as if he's trying to deny Mabel's illness Her problem only spirals from thereI did find some particular problems with this film I guess these problems were mostly present in the story, and the way some of the character acted toward the end Mabel has been committed, because, frankly, she's nuts Then, six months later, she's ready to come out of the hospital, and her husband throws a party to welcome her back He never acts stupid in the beginning of the movie Why would he invite all these people, some of them strangers to Mabel, over to his house when his wife is in such a fragile state It's simply idiotic Later, after Mabel comes in the house, Mabel's father has a huge outburst at Nick, screaming at the top of his lungs about not wanting to eat spaghetti His daughter has just gotten back from six months of rehabilitation, and the thing you want to do is keep her calm, and he goes nuts over spaghetti A few minutes later in the film, Nick brings Mabel into the stairwell and forces her to do the things she did when she was mentally unstable; make her weird noises and gestures Didn't he send her there to make her better and not do those things There were various other parts that occurred after this, but it would just be redundant to look at them in more detail I guess I just had a serious problem with the decision by Cassavetes to have his characters act in this way It simply didn't make senseHowever, although I had problems with the ending of the film, there was one aspect that really redeemed it; the acting Gena Rowlands played an amazing crazy woman There were times when I forgot she was acting, where I got so caught up in her wild gesticulations and crazy talk that I was actually scared of her She was amazingly convincing and intense However, I was also impressed by the rest of Mabel's family Peter Falk played a very strange character, and I almost thought he was crazy himself, because of the awkward way he handled his children, his job, and especially the situation with his wife I also usually don't appreciate child actors But the young people who played Nick and Mabel's children in this film were phenomenal It really felt like they were Mabel's children, because they seemed so attached to her and were so interesting in helping her with her problem I think their performances are one of the things that kept this film together, and without them it would have made the film less realistic and less intenseIn general I wasn't impressed by this film The story was jumbled and unclear, and the characters acted in ways that made me wonder who wasn't insane in the movie The only saving grace were brilliant lead acting roles of the Longhetti family Their realistic dialogue and powerful acting kept the film together, and are probably the only reason the film has ever amounted to anything\n",

A FOREST! Where did that forest come from Who decided to lay a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area How is this forest, in the last scene, suddenly on a hill over the city in question, while in the scenes inside the forest it looked deceptively FLAT From here I leave the judgment to you, and to your common sense Go and see this movie if you're looking for an unintended good laugh, I can really recommend it\n",
            "Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary about the Zephyr Skateboarding Team, and their influence on skateboarding It also focuses on the history of skateboarding It was directed by Stacy Peralta, a member of the original Zephyr Team, and was written by Stacy Peralta and Craig Stecyk, another member of the team The documentary stars the members of the Zephyr Team and is narrated by Sean PennThe documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding, and how it evolved from surfing It discusses skateboarding's popularity in the late 60s and the 70s, its decline in the 80s and its 'rebirth' in the 90s Skateboarding was introduced in Dogtown, the nickname of the poor side of Santa Monica, California The Zephyr Team originated from the Zephyr Surf Shop, which manufactured the first modern skateboards The documentary mainly consists of the original Zephyr Team members talking about the past in the Zephyr Team, the competitions they won, and their popularity and prestige It focuses on three particular members of the team; Peralta, Tony Alva, and Jay Adams, three virtuosos of skateboarding, and probably the best three members of the teamThe interviews in the documentary were usually voices over archival footage from Dogtown in the late 60s and 70s Very rarely to you actually see the people being interviewed, but when you do, they are shown in black and white, while the archival footage was in colour I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past (ie the Glory Days of the Zephyr Team) and not the present The documentary is very fast paced, in that we often see clips of impressive skateboarding over up-beat music of the era (such as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and David Bowie), and the interviews tend to be quick and to the point Knowing nothing about skateboarding (ie not even knowing how to ride one straight along the ground) I was very surprised that I found this documentary so interesting The reason is that this doco was more about the Zephyr Team than the actual sport of skateboarding, so while I couldn't relate to skateboarding, I could relate to the boys in the team Because it was made by actual members of the team, it gives it a little more depth and authenticityAll in all, I would have to say this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen It gave me a whole new insight, not just into the Zephyr Team, but into skateboarding as a whole For those who love skateboarding, I can only imagine how it must be even more interesting Seven and a half stars out of ten\n",

            "\"Look, I know this may suck right now, but pain is temporary, film is forever Whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come\" åÐ Robert De NiroThis was initially a film for Steven Spielberg, the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes And so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison Robert De Niro Like \"Jurassic Park\", \"Poltergeist\" and \"War of the Worlds\", the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast, the beast being the creation of the father, a lawyer who failed to defend De Niro during his trial In typical Spielberg fashion, the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and virtually every \"daddy\" figure in Spielberg land, the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that Spielberg so enjoysBut Spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to Martin Scorsese, who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare The result is arguably the worst film in Scorsese's filmography, and, ironically, his most illuminatingAn artist's failures or misfires are often very revealing, exposing the inner workings of their art When the story doesn't work, the characters don't connect or the images don't sear, we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core This åÐ the remaining carcass- is what the director's cinema is aboutNow \"Cape Fear\" is an impersonal film, so we won't find any thematic connections to the rest of Scorsese's filmography (\"You already sacrificed me!\" De Niro yells, but the films themes of Catholic redemption are cookie cutter) What the film does, though, is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on Watch how Scorsese's camera desperately whips back and forth, how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention But more importantly, watch how the film makes no spatial sense A showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound-stage, a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the family's house doesn't seem to exist anywhere in particular There is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture, Scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment The reason for this is that Scorsese's camera always has to be bound, or intimately tethered, to his central character For the world around the character to make sense, his camera has to be focused on the character Resnais can take you around a French Hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building, Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic, Scott can recreate an entire future cityscape, Lucas can give you an alien desert planet, and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook \"close up-mid shot-wide shot\" combinations, but Scorsese can't do this There's no poetry, no sense of tangible space in his films He's all about the character You break that tether, you leave that boxing ring, that taxi cab, you look away from De Niro, and everything collapses He simply cannot break away from this very documentarian style of shooting, which, in a way, is a prerequisite for action film-makingScorsese tried to rectify this problem with \"Gangs of New York\", where the space and the sets become the central character, but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of Daniel Day Lewis, the actor drawing Scorsese's camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb5/10 åÐ Even as a generic B-movie, this is an ugly, vulgar looking film Look at the matte paintings, the inept attempts at tension, the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown Still, we have Robert De Niro to pick up the slack De Niro, who gives his body over to Scorsese like a tattooed Christ, gives the film its only great scene In an improvised romantic sequence with young a Juliette Lewis, he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her A kind of symbolic rape, the girl runs away, both aroused and repelled by this man's interestBut De Niro's performance, so deliciously over the top, simply can't be imitated by Scorsese You'd need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like De Palma to make this work But Scorsese NopeWorth one viewing\n",

            "The film began with Wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend Her aunt (Edna May Oliver--a person too talented for this film) didn't like Wheeler--a sentiment I can easily relate to The aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from Wheeler They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king At about the same time, Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king So when Wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastimeI am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood--the silent era through the 1940s I have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been able to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers! Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood (cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey), I can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better For example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brother's film, DUCK SOUP, yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp At times, Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho, but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! In fact, he just seemed to prattle pointlessly His only funny quality was that he looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film Additionally, Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as \"who's on first\" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing In fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated I knew that \"who's on first\" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twistOnce again, I have found yet another sub-par film by this duo While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly (such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERS--which I actually gave 6's to on IMDb), this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey Where was all the humor!\n",

            "The arrival of White Men in Arctic Canada challenges the freedom of a fearless ESKIMO hunterW S Van Dyke, MGM's peripatetic director, was responsible for this fascinating look at life in the Arctic among the Inuit His production was on location filming from April 1932 until November 1933 (although some annoying rear projection effects show that some of the shooting took place back at the Studio) While considered a documentary at the time, we would likely term it a 'docudrama' as it is scripted with an intriguing plot & storylineThe film shows the daily life of the Eskimo, both Winter & Summer, and in fact starts in the warmer time of the year without any snow or ice in sight The constant striving for food is depicted, and the viewer gets to watch the exciting hunts for walrus, polar bear, whale & caribou The native language is used throughout, with the use of title cards; the only English is spoken by the fishermen & Mounties encountered by the Eskimo In fact, it is the arrival of White Men, both good & bad, and the change they make on Eskimo society, which is a major element in the narrativeThis Pre-Code film deals in a refreshingly frank manner with the Eskimo moral code, particularly with their practice of wife-sharing, which was an important and completely innocent part of their culture In fact, the entire film can be appreciated as a valuable look at a way of life which was rapidly disappearing even in the early 1930'sNone of the cast receives screen credit, which is a shame as there are some notable performances Foremost among them is that of Ray Wise, playing the leading role of Mala the Eskimo Wise (1906-1952) was an Alaskan Native of Inuit ancestry and is absolutely splendid and perfectly believable in what was a very demanding part As handsome as any Hollywood star, he would continue acting, using the name of Ray Mala, in a sporadic film career, often in tiny unbilled rolesLovely Japanese-Hawaiian actress Lotus Long plays Mala's loyal second wife; the names of the fine actresses playing his other two wives are now obscure Director Woody Van Dyke steps in front of the cameras as a strict North West Mounted Police inspector The two decent-hearted Mounties who must deliver Mala to Canadian justice are played by Joe Sawyer & Edgar Dearing, both longtime movie character actors Danish author Peter Freuchen, upon whose books the film was based, has a short vivid role of an evil wooden-legged sea captain who unwisely rouses Mala's icy wrath\n",
            "At first, I hadn't read the novel so far and I hadn't hear anything about the author yet But as I casually saw this movie, I was totally captive by the story Already as the Jewish watchman primary said, that he knows no one, who have a bad conscience about the war except from Howard W Campbell Junior, was such amazing objective and dissociates from simply moralizing the war Terrific! And the fictitious story about \"the most effective spy for the USA in WWII\", who have lost everything, that was important for his life, is wonderful emotional transcribed This is the best story about the duality of humanity, I've ever heard about! The questions, this movie is introducing, are in my opinion very important for our society: When does someone bear the guilt of something What is guilt Who is a hero and who is a felon What is important in our life Can you live without paying attention to the political changes Is the protagonist guilty or not These questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years This is a must see for everyone, who have to think about the acception of war!

I think what really struck me though, was how well Roxborough captured Grainger's outrageous personality Barbara Hershey's Rose was also a treasure If she looks considerably younger than Rose did at that period, it is more than made up for in how well she captured Rose's obsession with Percy It's an easy film to recommend (I should note that when she saw \"Passion\" my wife had no particular affinity for (or knowledge of) Grainger and his music, but she was totally captivated by the film\n",

            "The Running Man is often dismissed as being just another Arnie action thriller full of explosions, bad puns and gunfire, and to be fair, there is a lot of that in it People used to look at it and compare it to the Terminator series, saying it was one of the poorer Schwarzenegger filmsBut, give it 18 years, and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light Rather than just being another brainless action film, it works very well as a parody of reality TV It is quite different to the Stephen King book, true, but I doubt whether Hollywood, with its love of upbeat endings and so-called 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando, would have accepted it in its current formBut, on with the reviewBen Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop working in a dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past, and the entire country is ruled by a government/media conglomerate amalgamation The economy is in tatters, food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch, like Jumping for Dollars, where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs, and the most popular one is The Running Man, a gameshow hosted by the slimy Damian Killian (played by the entertaining Richard Dawson) where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical, pro-wresting-esquire 'stalkers'Some, however, try and speak up against the government When a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of Bakersfield, California, a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to 'calm' (ie kill) the protest When Richards refuses to fire on innocent people, he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd He is sentenced to a slave labour camp, but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and goes on the runHowever, his freedom does not last long, and after he kidnaps network employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to escape those pursuing him, he finds himself taken prisoner again, but this time he is forced to appear on The Running ManAnd there, of course, the entire film kicks into standard Arnie mode Richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles (why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds) and forced to run from the 'stalkers', along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him Amber also becomes curious about Richards' protestations of innocence, and discovers he was framed Guess what happens to her, then So, as Amber, Richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers, we soon become aware that Richards is no ordinary cop He's Super Arnie, the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in Christmas lights all while being just your average American guy with an Austrian accentYes, the remainder of the film becomes dumb, loud, classic 80's Arnie fun There's a lot of exciting fight sequences, the trademark dreadful puns ('He had to split' being my favourite), and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending It's a lot of fun watching Killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way, as well, and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the cursing old lady!) and the cold, cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratingsIf you expect a high-brow, intelligent film, you'll be disappointed But if you want a great 80s flick, well, this is it But the great thing about this film is it was quite propheticIf you look at the entertainment we have today, you'll have noticed the way reality TV is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame, and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on TV It's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile TV exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on TV We've already had that, however, with the ghoulish al-Qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet It seems that in the current climate, at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television setsWith that in mind, and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s, you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film Of course, we haven't reached there yet, as it's terrorists, rather than the mainstream media, who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death, but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity\n",

            "What is most striking about this semi-musical set in 1920s Berlin is the marvelous cinematography and editing It's top of the line from First National in these departments The story is mildly engaging and similar to the plots of Miller's other two films (SUNNY, SALLY) where working girl is romanced by rich boy with family disapproval, complications and final clinch All the four musical numbers are bunched at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without any further musical buoyancy Miller sings parts of I THINK OF BABY and reprises BECAUSE OF YOU There are also DON'T EVER BE BLUE and THOUGH YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST ONEMiller here is very engaging and delightful, quite reminiscent of Irene Dunne in manner and delivery Sad she does not dance as that is her forte SALLY remains her finest film, with this trailing as second and the rather poor SUNNY a vastly inferior runner up Her life was tragically cut short by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable It's worth visiting these films though to see Ziegfeld's top star of the twenties\n",
            "Honore De Balzac's genuinely bizarre short story on which this was loosely based gets an unsettling, albeit breathtakingly filmed, treatment here as a sort of forbidden-love blossoms over a period of time between man and beast in the early part of the nineteenth century Thin and very blonde English actor Ben Daniels plays the role of a young soldier during the Napoleonic wars who gets lost whilst escorting an exiled() french painter across the rugged, dangerous landscapes of the Gobi Desert After literally going around in circles the two men give up ever trying to reach civilization again, thus each decides (against better judgment mind you) to go their separate ways with the promise of both returning to the same exact spot when and if a water source is actually found This is of course how Daniels' character comes to encounter the creature (a wild and untamed female leopard) and eventually form a seemingly unbreakable bond, or rather love, with it that both saves his life and nearly destroys it by film's end The exquisite cinematography, minimalist dialog, somewhat demented story which arguably hints at possible bestiality in about three scenes are what ultimately lead professional critics to pan the film as pretentious and overlong rubbish While it is a film that isn't exactly for all tastes mind you, I find it to be a subtle, though decidedly left-of-center mixture of fantasy with a surreal and sumptuous atmosphere, highlighted by the fact that for more than half of the flick actor Ben Daniels is forced to perform opposite a wild animal (four leopards were actually used as opposed to just the one), which plain common sense and a slight knowledge of theatrics dictates that it must have been a maddening and very difficult job that he managed to pull off quite brilliantly if you ask me! Overall, I think that \"Passion in the Desert\" takes a while to warm up to, but if you're a patient person who is willing to give it some time it does in fact cast it's uniquely original spell over you in spite of everything; and unlike most platonic human and animal relationship stories it need not require a talking pig, monkey or shaggy dog to keep your interest throughout ( out of )\n",
