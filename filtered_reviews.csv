B004PEGIJY,"At the time of this review, Zevia Grape is not currently available for purchase on Amazon. I stumbled across the new flavor while shopping at my local WF store. Grape is easily one of Zevia's best varieties. They nailed the taste and you'll love drinking it.",5
B004PEGIJY,"I want to say up front that I hate the taste of stevia. I tried it years ago when it first became the natural sweetener to try. I gagged. I tried it again in its updated ""better"" offerings. Still don't like it. Not even the popular Truvia could win me over.<br /><br />But it's getting to be summer, and though I mostly drink water/coffee/tea/coconut milk, I wanted a nice summery change of taste without calories or sugar or aspartame. So, yeah, I tried this.<br /><br />I decided to check out the grape first, as that one got consistently good reviews in the websites/blogs I visited to see what folks are saying. I got it today.<br /><br />I'm drinking it now WARM (arrived at my Miami doorstep 15 mins ago, so imagine it's not anywhere near cool here). I figured I'd taste it and, if I didn't like it, not bother to have it take up precious space in my crowded-with-produce fridge. I had a worry that my stevia-repulsed tastebuds would yell, yet again.<br /><br />Well, blow me down with a carbonated breath! This is GOOD! So good, I decided to come on and review it positively.<br /><br />I'm guessing the major lifting work of sweetening is being done by the erythritol (which I've had in stuff before and never bothered me, though I did sense the cooling effect). That's fine by me. I don't get weird rumbly tums from erythritol, and it's never had any funky effect on me like some report with aspartame.<br /><br />So, hey, I have a summer soda pop! I'm gonna order a six-pack of various other flavors to see if they measure up. The grape definitely measures up. And I'm even enjoying it WARM. :) I can't wait to see how it is fully chilled.<br /><br />And I appreciate that it doesn't have weird purple coloring. It's a clear fizzy liquid in my cup. I hate weird colored sodas.<br /><br />Thanks, Zevia. Nice grapey treat.",5
B004PEGIJY,If I was a fan of grape soda then I would certainly purchase Zevia grape. It has a nice grape flavor that isn't overly sweet.,4
B004PEGIJY,"CAUTION...DO NOT use ice cubes in any Zevia soda.<br />I am hooked on Zevia sodas because their tastes are not ""heavy."" Each flavored soda seems to have just the right amount of taste. Once you add ice, the taste seems to get watered down.<br />Zevia is my new soda of choice.",4
B004PEGIJY,"I bought these for my husband at WF, because he is supposed to stay away from sugary soft drinks and fruit juices.  We've tried a bunch of sugar free beverages, and this one has been the best. My husband is a meat and potatoes guy who is not interested in any diet-beverages, so getting him to try and then to regularly drink a 0-calorie beverage is a huge deal.  He likes the Zevia and asked me to get more of them - yipeeee!  He is going to be so much healthier, so I'm happy.",5
B004PEGIJY,"I was on the HCG diet at the time that I ordered this product, it takes some getting used to but it is great. This product is great, it works for any diet and my kids love it!!",5
B004PEGIJY,"Grape Zevia is great!  It is my favorite flavor that I have tried....(cream soda, rootbeer, orange, lemon/lime).  It tastes really 'grapey' very close to the grape soda I had as a child.  Love love love it.",5
B004PEGIJY,"I've been a Zevia fan since it came on the market. The grape is the best flavor... it tastes like regular grape soda, not at all diet-like.",5
B004PEGIJY,"I think Zevia rocks period so maybe I am biased but whatever :)<br />This is my favorite flavor they have. Tastes just like regular grape soda minus the 76 grams of sugar/hfcs, artificial flavors and colors. I was honestly a bit shocked as to how good it tasted.<br />Love the fact that it is not purple either, rad.<br />Certified vegan to top it off, can't go wrong.",5
B004PEGIJY,"I love Grape soda and this satisfies my craving without the guilt or worry about sugar or controversial synthetic sugars.<br /><br />In fact, I like almost all Zevia soda. Good stuff!",5
B004PEGIJY,I wasn't disappointed!  Crisp and clear grape soda!!  Loved this drink and will definitely order it when I run out.,5
B004PEGIJY,Good soda substitute for good health. Gets boring. Need to change it up in terms of flavor. Get different ones. Best when cold.,5
B004PEGIJY,"I grew up in an exclusively diet cola home.  I got to nearly hate diet soda... uhg..  Even now, I would rather drink water to ""real"" OR diet soda.  I loved to sneak sugary grape soda as a child, however.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think diet grape soda even existed when I was a youngster.<br /><br />This stuff takes me back to the forbidden treat of my past.  It even smells the same.  If you grew up, like me, loving grape soda, try this product.  You won't be disappointed!",5
B004PEGIJY,I can't even give this any stars.  Nastiest stuff on earth!  Tastes like chemicals and medicine with carbination!  Will never order it again!,1
B004PEGIJY,"The only thing that I would change about this drink is that I wish it had caffeine in it.<br /><br />However, even though it's caffeine free, it's one of the best grape sodas that I've ever tasted.  (I'm also very picky.)<br /><br />It's crisp, has great grape flaver, has the right amount of fizz.....it really is awesome!  It's also clear (not purple colored).",4
B004PEGIJY,"I've always been a fan of grape soda, but I never drank it that much compared to the colas.  Mostly because my favorite was ""Nehi Grape"" and it was super difficult to find.  Harder to find than TAB, even.  Fast forward maybe 15 years, Zevia comes out with Zevia Grape and it's awesome.<br /><br />It has a very similar flavor to Nehi Grape, but with stevia instead.  It's a little on the sweet side, but not hypersweet or bitter like some of their other flavors (mountain zevia and grapefruit citrus/ginger ale, respectively).  This is a by far my favorite zevia flavor in their lineup of sodas; and it's close to perfect.<br /><br />One final note: I want to say is that this is a fakegrape flavor, and although it is pleasant, it resembles nothing to grape juice whatsoever.",5
B004PEGIJY,"The best grape soda I've tasted in a long time has a very natural real taste I will buy this again, I highly recommend zevia grape.",5
B004PEGIJY,"I was hoping for a sugar-free version of the popular purple grape sodas, with that traditional big purple grape taste.  This soda does not have that.  It has a nice, not overly-sweet, flavor to it.  But it is not very grape-y.",4
B004PEGIJY,"Maybe it's because it's my first experience with Stevia... but I thought this soda tasted horrible! I had one can and can't bring myself to drink another one. We're donating it to the food pantry, but honestly I feel bad for the people that will have to drink it. I'm normally not harsh with reviews, but I have to say this product is BAD.",1
B001EQ5F9K,"This is one of my family's favorite cereals.  Even my son likes it, and that's saying a lot.  It's light and crunchy, full of cinnamon flavor with just a touch of sweetness.<br /><br />Low in fat and calories, sugar is not too bad in my book (that's always debatable depending on who you ask, but I don't think 8 grams per serving is horrible).  It even contains fiber and protein and 9 vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />We love this cereal for breakfast, or any time we need a quick on the go snack in a bag.<br /><br />per 3/4 cup serving:<br />Calories - 120<br />total fat - 1.5 grams<br />protein - 3 grams<br />fiber - 2 grams<br />sugars - 8 grams<br />total carbohydrate - 25 grams",5
B001EQ5F9K,I am intolerant to High Fructose Corn Syrup and Life is one of the few cereals that I can find that doesn't contain HFCS.,5
B001EQ5F9K,"Not much to say if you've already had this cereal...if you haven't, BUY IT! So good! Subtle cinnamon taste. Great packaging (honestly, the boxes were pristine, much better looking than even in the stores lol). Great price. Thanks Amazon!",5
B001EQ5F9K,my kids favorite life cereal by far.  we go through a ton of this stuff (and mom likes it too!),5
B001EQ5F9K,"So I have to admit that I am a cinnamon NUT.  I just plain love the spice in so many recipes I could never count. When Quaker first put this out I was a few trepidations about it.  Having loved the original flavor of Life cereal since as far back as I can remember I wasn't sure how they could add cinnamon to it and make it work - they did.  I'm one that loves to mix cereals and this one mixed with the Cinnamon Burst Cheerio's - love it so much I pretty much have this every day!<br />Get a box and try it!  If you enjoy cinnamon AND you enjoy original I think you'll enjoy this.  I do wish Amazon hadn't removed the 'Subscribe and Save' option - in all honesty, their full price for this is too much above what I can get it at the local discount store (I won't blame Amazon for not publishing this review!)",5
B001EQ5F9K,"This is my favorite cereal. When we have it in the house I eat it every day, sometimes twice a day, so it doesn't last long. I'm a big fan of ""sticky"" cereal, and what I mean by that is cereal that is not soggy but not out-of-the-box crunchy, either. This cereal turns to oatmeal mush fairly quickly (I hate oatmeal, oddly), so if you like it less-than-soggy, you have to be quick or go easy on the milk. It tastes fantastic, though. It's not too sugary nor does it taste like cardboard. It's just right, honestly, and it's a lot healthier than a lot of other cereals (although it is not the healthiest). A bowl of this while watching LOTR is a perfectly comforting combination for some reason. (:",5
B001EQ5F9K,"Love the cereal!  But a word to the wise regarding purchasing the 6-pack via the Subscribe and Save program...  the price on this item seems to fluctuate significantly.<br /><br />When I first ordered it in Jan. 2011 (and signed-on to periodically reorder at a 90 day interval via Subscribe and Save) the price was $9.62.  When my next shipment arrived, it cost $11.87 (approx. 25% higher than before).<br /><br />The current price on this item is $17.57, including the 15% Subscribe and Save discount (an 85% increase in the price of the item since I originally started the Subscribe and Save program for this item.<br /><br />While I suspect this phenomenon could happen with any Subscribe and Save item, I was surprised by the variability in price and wanted to offer a ""heads-up"" to my fellow Subscribe and Savers as well as prospective purchasers.",5
B001EQ5F9K,"I love this cereal so much, it is my favorite right now. It's the perfect amount of cinnamon, sugar and grain. While others have a problem with the sugar content, that's what I love so much about it, there's sugar crystals in this cereal that other cereals don't have. Yeah it does get soggy pretty fast, but that's not really a bad thing because it tastes great either way you go!",5
B001EQ5F9K,"In NYC supermarkets this stuff is $5 per box, so I'm getting it here at Amazon for half the price, and saving the hassle of carrying it a mile back home... win/win!<br /><br />I do wish there was a way to do a variety pack, tho. :)",4
B001EQ5F9K,"What more can I say?  The price was great and the cereal fantastic.  Admittedly, my family was a bit hesitant to commit so much to a single cereal, but they soon discovered that, unlike most other cereals, one does not grow weary of Cinnamon Life.<br /><br />Neither will you!",5
B001EQ5F9K,"This cereal is not so sugar-blasted as many kids' cereals are, but it has a nice level of sweetness, with a few sugar crystals on the outside of each piece of cereal, and the cinnamon flavor is also nice. It's a pretty good cereal, I enjoyed it as a kid and still enjoy it as an adult. It has a decent shelf life in milk, staying crunchy for a while and even after getting soaked, it still has a bit of firmness around it.",4
B001EQ5F9K,"I have begun purchasing all of my cereal in bulk from Amazon and have had great success so far. This 6-pack arrived padded and shrink wrapped, in great shape. I think the cereal itself is more delicate in nature to some other types of cereal and I suspect it may be ever so slightly more subject to settling that heartier cereals. The package I received all had an extremely good date.<br /><br />As far as the taste, Cinnamon Life is fantastic and mild - not too heavy on the cinnamon. It has slightly more sugar than regular Life and I think I can taste that extra bit. One of my top picks.",4
B001EQ5F9K,I love Cinnamon Life and this was a really great deal - especially when you sign up for the Subscribe and Save.  Love it!!,5
B001EQ5F9K,"Life cereal is quite tasty. Cinnamon Life is even better. It's sweet, but not so sickeningly sweet that only a child could like it. I'm an adult and I enjoy eating it regularly.<br /><br />What's better than Cinnamon Life? Cinnamon Life at Amazon prices. The ""regular price"" for a box of this cereal at local grocery stores is in the neighborhood of $3-4. Outrageous. I commonly see supermarkets offer it for $2.00 in their weekly ads. That's more reasonable.<br /><br />However, Amazon's regular price undercuts even the supermarket sale price if you choose the Subscribe and Save option. Plus, when you do Subscribe and Save you can choose your shipment rate based on your consumption rate, never have to worry about running out, and get free shipping! What's not to love?",5
B001EQ5F9K,This is great to have handy as a sweet cereal and it makes me feel like a kid again. but it has a lot of sugar so back to oatmeal the rest of the week.,3
B001EQ5F9K,"It tastes good and I like it. But too much sugar!! Excessive sugar makes it attractive, but I doubt it's good for health. Literally, I can find a layer of sugar at the bottom of the bowl....... For the sake of health, I'll give it up.",2
B001EQ5F9K,"It seemed like good deal at the time, but I found better deals at my local meijer's.",3
B001EQ5F9K,"Last month I paid $12 for 6 on Subscribe and save, and now it is $25!  What????<br /><br />Guess you don't want my business",1
B001EQ5F9K,"Although the cereal is a great tasting cereal I gave this one star because the price of $41.50 that they are selling it for here on Amazon is rediculous!!! That's almost $7 a box. I don't know about you but I know I've never paid $7 for a box of cereal. Wal-Mart sells the 21 oz. (6 pack) of Life Cinnamon cereal for $19.68. Just make sure you shop around because when you see a deal that you think may be to good to be true, it probably is NOT a good deal.",1
B001SER0L4,"Breastmilk has sugar in it, it is why a lot of breastfed babies will refuse formula supplementing. Similic is a godsend for me as I can never feed exclusive breastmilk, I must supplement at least 2 oz. formula after each breastfeeding, even with pumping. We only drink organic milk b/c my husband is allergic to the pesticide they put in the feed of the cows and breaks out in a horrible rash when he drinks nonorganic milk, so for our baby we would not use any formula besides organic. That being said my son would not drink Earth's Best as it is not sweet like my milk is sweet, when we found Similac organic it was such a blessing as he finally would drink it no problem. Similac has put a lot of effort into helping Moms who cannot breastfeed, they listened and developed a product that tastes most like Moms milk. My son is 3 now and has no cavities at all.<br />We will use nothing else for baby girl coming soon and I came here to make sure I had some ordered this time before hand, I love the convenience of having formula, diapers and wipes delivered right to the door each month!",5
B001SER0L4,"I thought I was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought Similac was a brand I could trust to be good for baby. That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...] Needless to say I'm switching to another brand.<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.<br /><br />No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity.",2
B001SER0L4,"This is the only formula we used once I stopped nursing my son when he was 8 months old. It is a bit expensive, but it's worth it if you're concerned about having organic formula. My son had no problem switching from breast milk to this formula.",5
B001SER0L4,"We have now gone through 4 formulas, and here are our conclusions.<br /><br />Similac (non-organic): They use cows which have been given growth hormones.  Seriously, even most non-organic milks in grocery stores do not use growth hormones.  Our baby spent his first four months off the growth-charts until it finally dawned on me to check into this.<br /><br />Similac Organic: Our baby liked this one, but then a NYT article revealed that this formula has a significant amount of cane sugar added - no wonder he liked it.  I disagree with other reviewers' comments that ""breast milk normally contains sugar"".  Breast milk contains the sugar LACTOSE, not cane sugar.  Lactose is a natural sugar and should be the basis of any baby formula.<br /><br />Earth's Best: We really struggled with the transition from Similac to Earth's Best.  We went through a 2 week transition of 3/4 Similac, 1/4 Earth's Best...with a slow increase in the Earth's Best.  Even to our adult taste senses, it had a fishy odor and taste (likely the DHA, which is supposedly taken from seaweed for this brand).  And it NEVER WENT INTO SOLUTION.  We would constantly have to interrupt his feeds to check and see whether the nipple was clogged - being a baby, he would suck and suck -- even when no milk was coming out.  Our baby developed eczema - I am not convinced the formula caused the problem.  Babies get eczema.  But after trying everything else (detergents, lotions, soaps, etc) and reading some reviews questioning whether Earth's Best caused eczema, we decided to try one more formula switch.<br /><br />Baby's Only Organic: ""Now here is something I can add to my coffee when we run out of milk,"" says my husband.  It has a wonderful smell of oatmeal.  No transition needed, our baby finished an entire 8oz in one sitting.  It goes into solution better than both the Similac and the Earth's Best.  No GI distress or constipation when we made the switch.  I agree with other reviewers that it is annoying that the canisters are small, but scoop for scoop, it is less expensive than Earth's Best.  Just waiting for Amazon to have a ""subscription"" discount.  I highly recommend Baby's Only!",1
B001SER0L4,"I wanted an organic formula for my 5 week old daughter since breasfeeding didn't work out for us. After she was on this formula for about a week, she became severely constipated and gassy. I searched the internet and found that many other people had this same problem with this formula. We switched her to the non-organic Similac Advance and the constipation cleared up almost immediately. I would love to use an organic formula that did not cause digestive issues.",1
B001SER0L4,I had been using Similac advanced formula and thought I was happy with it until I thought about switching to organic.  Knowing that my baby is getting a little less exposure to the hormones and chemicals in regular formula is worth it to me.,5
B001SER0L4,After much research and being forced to switch from breast milk to formula when my little guy was 3 months old I chose Similiac organic. It was the right decision! My very sensitive guy tolerates it very well and loves the taste. I add a little rice to it for his reflux and he never spits up. Plus it's organic!,5
B001SER0L4,"My baby had bad reflux and spit-up and we tried multiple formulas including those specifically made for spit up.  The Similac Organic is the first one that he has shown very little to no spit up after eating.  Great for him, bad for me because it is a bit pricier.  Not sure what is different about it that it affects his spit up differently but happy it works.  I did run out and used some packets we had on hand of another formula and the spit up immediately returned.  I knocked down one star because I really don't understand why the label ""organic"" has to mean much more money.  Health should be affordable and accessible.",4
B001SER0L4,"I wanted to solely breastfeed but was unable to keep up and had to supplement formula.  I chose Similac because they are a very reputable company and I had a ton of it from the hospital.  We have used both the powder and ready made and he likes both.  He got a little constipated at the beginning but has been on it now for 5 months and no problems.  I read some other reviews about sucrose...well, sucrose is just sugar and ALL formula has sugar in it.  Other companies just label it differently and since ths one is organic it has to contain a pure sugar.  As far as the hexane goes, I did my research, ALL formulas except one (Babys Only) use the hexane method.  Babys Only contains brown rice syrup that has been shown to have high levels of arsenic..uh, no thanks.  Also Similac has been tested and found to have no hexane present in the product.  Overall my baby is healthy and smart so I am very happy with this formula.",5
B001SER0L4,"Our baby girl is 8 months now. I breastfed for 4 months, then she was on Baby's Only for 2 months, till I found out the brown rice syrup they use as a sweetener contains arsenic, according to a study by Dartmouth University. Here is a link: [....]<br />So after I researched that issue, I decided trace amounts, if any, of hexane to extract omega 3/DHA is still a much better option than arsenic, which is a very destructive poison. Our baby has done great on Similac organic. I""m even taking it to Europe where we will be for 5 weeks this summer. She will be on this formula till she is at least 18 months, since I think it has a lot more nutritional value than cow's milk alone.<br />Hope you found this review helpful. Good luck in your search to find the best formula for your baby! :)",5
B001SER0L4,This formula caused my baby to be very constipated. He's also not slept well since being on it (tummy ache?). I'm switching to Earth's best.<br />Also it doesn't fully mix or dissolve in the water. It appears grainy. I've also read bad things about the fact that it contains cane sugar (which can supposedly contribute to diabetes in later life and tooth decay now).,1
B001SER0L4,"Baby liked the flavor of this just fine, and seemed to really gulp it down and eat a little more of it than the regular formula she usually drinks. (Maybe due to the added sugar in it? - Which I didn't know about when I purchased it.)<br /><br />This did cause minor constipation though, and that was alternating between this, and the regular formula. So I'm wondering if I had been feeding her only this, if the constipation would've been major? It's really disappointing, but the formula we are using now works great for us, so that's what matters most.",4
B001SER0L4,My baby likes it as soon as she stop brestfeeding or expressed brest milk and switch to formula; I like it a lot also since this does not smell as strong as the most poupular advanced type; the only thing I do not like it is their cane sugar part; but I have tried many other brands or types and my baby only wants this one. So even though my grocery store stop carrying them I still have to buy these milke online!!,4
B001SER0L4,"I have 3 kids and the first two we used Nestle Good Start.  Good Start had the problem of not dissolving well - and so you had to shake it a LOT.<br /><br />My 3rd baby we used this Similac organic having switched him from breastmilk.  He didn't have a problem taking it.  And it dissolves very well.<br /><br />The packaging is very space efficient and convenient with the ""click"" lid so that you know its securely closed.",5
B001SER0L4,"good product! my son like this very much , and I believe the orgnic formula is the best food for infant!",5
B001SER0L4,"I used Similac with my first two children (one full time formula, second as a supplement). I intended on using this organic formulation with my third, until I did more research. Similac chooses to use cheaper quality ingredients i.e cane sugar instead of lactose in this formula. It's the ""cheap"" way of making infant milk, although the product isn't cheap. Babies love it because it's loaded with extra, actual sugar instead of milk lactose similar to what is in breastmilk. Sadly, this formula is one of those scams by companies trying to get a piece of the green hype. Check out other brands instead. Earth's Best offers a better organic option for your child.",1
B001SER0L4,"I GOT IT FROM THORNTON ON DECEMBER 08, ITS BEEN ALMOST A MONTH  AND HALF, STILL DID NOT GET IT AND THEY DON'T E-MAIL ME BACK.THE REFUND CAN TAKE 4 WEEKS. THE FORMULA IS GOOD,IT HAVE THE SAME DHA/ARA THAN EARTH'S BEST THAT WE STOP BUYNG BECAUSE THEY USE CHEMICALS TO EXTRACT THE DHA/ARA STUF.NO MUCH CHOICES OUT THERE,I DON'T KNOW HOW SIMILAC EXTRACT IT,JUST HOPE IT IS WITH WATER.",3
B001SER0L4,"(1) the seller didn't inform the buyers in advance they would replace 23.2 oz tubs with smaller 12.9 oz cans BEFORE they purchased 23.2 oz tubs (pack of 6) (2) i didn't bother to return the smaller cans as i though they should be the same in terms of contents.  Yet some of the smaller 12.9 cans formula had ""fishy"" smell, I only found such ""defect"" when my baby refused to drink the milk.  I have to discard some of the formula at the end.  I am not sure if the smaller 12.9 oz cans were old stock (contrary to the newly marketed 23.2 oz-tub package) which generated the fishy smell.",2
B001SER0L4,"Since I received the similac,I have never open it,but I think the powder will be very well.Incase I want to say thank you similac company.",5
B003UEKFS0,"Disappointed that I could no longer find Twinings Blackcurrant tea on the supermarket shelves, I was glad to find that I could order it on line. It is the only Twinings black flavored tea that I like--not too fruity, but with just a touch of berry flavor that adds to, rather than detracts from, the basic black tea. It leaves no bitter taste and the aroma is inviting.  Wish the markets would start carrying it again.",5
B003UEKFS0,"I'm a big fan of Peet's Black Currant Black Tea, which only comes in tea leaves in a tin. I use it at home all the time and I love it, but at home I can make it in a teapot and I have a personal-sized one that makes two mugs.  So I wanted black currant flavored black tea in teabag form for use at the office, where I just make one mug at a time.  (The teapot shtick is too much trouble at work and takes up too much time.)  So I found this black currant tea and figured it would be good -- it's Twining's after all -- and I went for six boxes of 20 teabags each.  Now I realize -- I probably should have paid closer attention to the illustration of the box -- that it's artificially flavored.  These teabags smell artificial compared to Peet's, and the black currant aroma of these teabags is faint compared to what I experience when I open a tin of Peet's.  When I brew a mug of tea, it has adequate flavor, but the black currant flavor is overshadowed by the artificial boysenberry-like flavoring they've added and that detracts.  I don't want my black currant flavored black tea to smell and taste of artificial boysenberry  I expect better from Twining's.  I'll stick with Peet's and I'll simply drink it at home and have another kind of tea at work.",2
B003UEKFS0,"This and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UEKF5S"">Twinings Pomegranate Delight, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> are my favorite easy-to-find, flavored black teas.  I originally got hooked on Twinings when I found a box of the Pomegranate Delight at Walmart a couple of years ago.  Since then it is really difficult to find that flavor so I usually get the blackcurrant one.  Both are really good!<br /><br />I solely use them to make iced tea and use 2 bags of one variety of flavored black tea in one container and 2 bags of one variety of flavored green tea in another container.  The best green teas for mixing & icing that I've found are the Lipton variety such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F2O70W"">Lipton Green Tea, Mixed Berry, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IJT8VG"">Lipton Green, Superfruit, Black Currant and Vanilla, 20-Count  Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>. They are affordable and have less bite/tartness and floater powdery stuff that sinks to the bottom than other brands.<br /><br />Let the containers cool and put it in a 32 oz to-go cup in the refrigerator and my work day is set for success!  Some teas I feel like get gross or funky after a day or two sitting in the fridge.  This one is still delicious the next day or two if I don't drink it all the first day.  Subscribe and save makes them cheaper than constantly hunting down sales at the grocery store.  And I have a six month supply!  Win-win, thanks Amazon.",5
B003UEKFS0,I brew two of these bags with two Lipton bags and make a pitcher of iced tea.  FANTASTIC that way.,5
B003UEKFS0,"Very smooth, with a light current flavor; not at all bitter.  One of the best I've ever tasted -- this and a good Darjeeling are my favorites.",5
B003UEKFS0,Every 6 to 7 weeks I buy a case of this tea because I like it very much.<br />And I do recommend it to all tea lovers.,5
B003UEKFS0,i don't like black tea because they have a bitter taste. i love this tea. it has a really good flavor and smells nice too. there is no bitter taste.,5
B003UEKFS0,"A strongly flavored black tea. The blackcurrant flavor is strong enough to overpower the tea - do not over-steep this. 3 minutes is usually good; anything past 5 is going to be very strong. I take mine with milk, but it's certainly fine without it.<br /><br />I started having a hard time finding this tea several years back, when Whole Foods pulled it from its shelves. It turns out the blackcurrant flavor is partly artificial, so it doesn't meet Whole Foods standards. Since then, I looked all over Austin, Texas for another supplier. Never found one, but getting it 6 boxes at a time works pretty well.",5
B003UEKFS0,"Still delicious after all these years and the recent tweaking of the formula and name.  Even though I think there's a tad less fruitiness about it, it remains my go-to hot drink in the mornings and in the evenings.  And if you have a sweet tooth like me, go hogwild and add a dash (or a glug) of French vanilla creamer, and you have a warm black raspberry milkshake kind of deal.  All the Twinings teas are worth the search and the price.",5
B003UEKFS0,"This is my favorite afternoon tea.  I sweeten and lighten it, but in the summer, it is great iced and plain.",5
B003UEKFS0,"My entire family goes crazy over this tea. It's the first Twinings tea I tried and while I order other Twinings tea flavors I always include a few boxes of Blackcurrant Breeze with every order. I personally like it hot with no sugar (it's already sweet) but my wife and daughter have a sweet tooth and do add sugar. Every single time they take the first drink they do this squinty-faced happy dance while giggling. In all seriousness, every time. I might be forced to admit to an occasional grin of satisfaction myself when I drink this concoction.<br /><br />It also makes an incredible iced tea...hopefully that doesn't get any English knickers in a bunch.",5
B003UEKFS0,This is my favorite black tea. And it is not available in most of the grocery stores by me. So it is noce to beable to get it in bulk through amazon.,5
B003UEKFS0,"This tea is delicious.  It's slightly fruity and has a wonderful aroma.  A great tea for relaxation.  It slightly reminds me of the ""Mighty Leaf- African Nectar"" tea.",5
B003UEKFS0,I have been drinking this tea for 20 years!!!  Can't live without it - add a little cream and it's a real treat -,5
B003UEKFS0,"I, too, had a lot of difficulty finding this tea and was glad to see it on Amazon.  I was introduced to this tea in the 1980's by a friend who recommended adding a little maple syrup to it.  That got me started, but I no longer add syrup. The balance and blend of this tea is just too perfect to distort.  For my taste it is superior to any of the flavored or plain black teas I have tried.",5
B003UEKFS0,"How pleased I was to find Twinings Black Currant tea in the Amazon listings.  I've looked<br />before, and it was evidently discontinued for a while.  It hasn't been available on my local market<br />shelves in about 10 years.  Now if we could just get Delaware Punch back in California again.  Too bad I<br />really can't afford that hefty weight shipping price on canned beverages. (sigh)<br /><br />Very compatible if you sweeten your tea or add lemon, I've been using honey in tea and coffee for<br />years in  defiance of  allergies.  Less mess and easy access is also a pinch of powdered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014UCJ8Q"">Citric Acid 100% Pure 4 Ounces</a>",5
B003UEKFS0,"This tea is amazing, ever since I had this tea at one of the Walt Disney World resorts I have become a fan and finally I found it for a decent price on Amazon.<br />The price is just right and subscribe and save discount is awesome.",5
B003UEKFS0,"This Twinings Tea Blackcurrant offer is just great (from Amazon), the 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) is an offer we cannot let it pass by, product is excellent, I got this idea from a family member who showed me an empty back, and ask me to get more, so I ordered for me too.<br />Great product for a very low price. Thanks.",5
B003UEKFS0,"It was great to find it someplace I could buy a nice quantity (the stores around here run out quickly), at a great price!",5
B0005XO2ME,The above delightful reviews are sadly recalling a different product. The Lea & Perrins that is sold in the US now uses high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar (which is what is still in the UK version.) This may not matter to some but it definitely detracts from the authentic clean spicy taste by making it more sickly sweet which the original is not. It really becomes apparent in Bloody Mary's and also in scrambled eggs or toasted cheese (Welsh Rarebit.) Bring a bottle back from the UK and compare the difference. A pity because it must mean only a cent or so difference in the manufacturing cost.,1
B0005XO2ME,"They've reformulated their product and the high-fructose corn syrup was replaced with real sugar.  I compared several bottles at the store and this one had the most natural ingredients.  I'm no Worcestershire sauce expert, but it tastes great to me!",5
B0005XO2ME,"Frankly, this isn't worth the bottle it's put in. Heinz have really screwed the pooch on a wonderful, traditional product. Not only were the sugars replaced by HFCS, but the wonderful malt vinegar has been substituted with a more generic (read: cheaper) distilled vinegar. These two things alone result in a product that not only lacks the subtlety and spice of the original, but one that leaves a nasty, cloying aftertaste. I'n not even going to get into the potential health risks of HFCS--if the stuff tasted good, I probably wouldn't care, considering the small amount used. But, it does NOT taste good, and as a life-long Lea & Perrins devotee, I feel completely ripped off by Heinz's cost-cutting measures. Maybe some people can't tell the difference, but I'm betting a lot more can.<br /><br />My question to Heinz would be, why the hell buy a company, just to completely ruin up its flagship product? Or, is it that they didn't want competition for their third-rate ""Worcestershire sauce?"" Now that I think about it, the new L&P tastes a lot like the rubbish in the Heinz bottle. Maybe one and the same? Gak.<br /><br />Fortunately, as others have mentioned, you can still get something that more closely resembles the real thing from both Europe and Canada. Do your homework. It's worth the couple extra pence to get the real thing.",1
B0005XO2ME,"The american and european (UK, Canada, etc) market products are very different. Heinz messed things up for us americans by replacing genuine sugar and molasses with ""high fructose corn syrup"" which leaves aslippery gumminess on the tongue and a basically slimy aftertaste. The ""other"" (UK, Canada)sauce is clean, sharp with distinct flavor layers and a beautiful, long-lasting aftertaste. Sorry. I order my product from Canada for the same cost, and hope Amazon soon offers the ""foreign"" product.",1
B0005XO2ME,HFCS - High Fructose Corn Syrup - is processed differently by your body than sugar and is considerably worse. Do not trust the propaganda of the subsidized Big Ag in America for your truthful info on food.<br /><br />You can get an organic version from Annie's.,1
B0005XO2ME,"I've always avoided the Lea&Perrins brand due to using hfcs but today I was in the store and I was happy to find Lea&Perrins ""all natural"" it uses sugar instead. Seek it out if you want the true original.",2
B0005XO2ME,"First of all, this L&P Worcestershire does NOT have high fructose corn syrup<br />anymore, the company actually listened to their customers and made the switch<br />back to sugar. As if anybody could tell the difference between the two, very<br />sophisticated taste buds at work here. LOL<br /><br />Second, this HFCS scare is just like any other of these silly food alerts that<br />began about the same time the internet sprang up....not to be taken seriously,<br />everything in moderation right.<br /><br />Anyway, in spite of all these silly negative ""reviews"" (which are nothing but a<br />personal political statement and not about the product), this is still the best<br />and the only REAL Worcestershire Sauce on the market. Hell, a Bloody Mary is not<br />even a Bloody Mary without L&P, and its perfect for making BBQ sauce, in chili,<br />roasts, and dozens of other uses that will accept no other substitute. 5 stars<br />for this great staple, one pitiful star for all the frightened and brainwashed<br />consumers leaving these idiotic reviews.",5
B0005XO2ME,"I've been buying and enjoying L&P Worcestershire Sauce for 30+ years.  Now they've changed the recipe, it doesn't look or taste anything like the old product.  Store brands are better now.  What a shame!",1
B0005XO2ME,"The true ""original"" is the UK version, which contains malt vinegar and spirit vinegar. This product is the US version, which contains distilled white vinegar instead. I've compared both versions side by side and found that it's even possible to _smell_ the difference. As you may well imagine, the difference in taste is considerable.<br /><br />Please note that this issue is entirely separate from the matter of the high-fructose corn syrup mentioned in so many other reviews. The US version no longer contains HFCS, but it's still not the ""original"" -- and it's not as pungent and strongly flavored as the true UK original.<br /><br />Use the UK version (with the orange label) and accept no substitutes. Especially when they lie and claim to be ""original.""",1
B0005XO2ME,"Not Genuine!  High Fructose Corn Syrup in this one.  You are buying a Heinz knock off.  For the Genuine sauce you need the one still made in England called ""Original and Genuine.""  See wikipedia for more info.",1
B0005XO2ME,"I'm not sure how much the HFCS had to do with the difference- or the difference in vinegar.. but one thing is for certain, it tastes different from what I remember growing up. And I can confirm the difference visually. The test of Lea & Perrins is to take a white plate and put enough of the sauce to just cover the surface of the plate. It used to be a dark color, now it's a light tan color. WHAT IS THIS? It no longer has the tangy bold flavor, and instead tastes like a watered down version of its former self. I find myself piling on twice as much to try to bring back the old flavor, but never quite getting it. What happened to you lea and perrins? I miss you!<br /><br />I'm going to buy the direct UK stuff and see if it's good.",1
B0005XO2ME,"As other reviewers have noted, this version of Lea & Perrins' ""original"" Worcestershire sauce is far from the traditional recipe that's been used since 1838. As mentioned in the product description above, this product contains high fructose corn syrup. I hear Heinz has finally gone back to using sugar in the recipe this year (see the ingredients listing for the US version on the L&P website), but unless and until this product information is updated, I'll assume what's being sold here is old inventory containing HFCS. If in doubt, stick with the bottles with orange labels if you can find them - that is the imported British Worcestershire sauce, and will most definitely be HFCS-free.<br /><br />Good on Heinz for listening to the opinions of their customers, though!",2
B0005XO2ME,"Despite being sold under the same label, the Lea & Perrins available in the U.S. is NOT the real thing - as others have noted, it contains high fructose corn syrup. Aside from high fructose corn syrup being ridiculously bad for you, it does change the flavor. Not to mention, it's a false claim, as the American version is not 'the original'. See if you have any friends in England to send you the real stuff :)",1
B0005XO2ME,"after reading of all of the whining reviews over high fructose corn syrup bla bla bla I have to comment. First off I am sick and tired of the HFC syrup rants and the mis-information about this product.<br />Let me tell you, this product tastes just as it did 40 years ago when I started using it. Do not let all of these bad reviews scare you away. The lets jump on the band wagon anti HFC syrup people are out trolling the internet bashing every product that has HFC syrup in it...<br />This is still good sauce.",5
B0005XO2ME,"While this kind does have high fructose corn syrup, Lea & Perrins offers an ""all natural"" variety which does not. That one has good ingredients and I recommend seeking that out instead of this one. I found it at the grocery store, but I don't see it on Amazon.",1
B0005XO2ME,"When I grew up in south Mississippi, we did not have all the seasonings I use now that I have become a Louisiana spice mouth.  We simply had the basics -- salt, pepper, a little sugar, vanilla, nutmeg, lemon juice, garlic, ketchup, mustard, homemade pepper sauce, and Lea & Perrins®. For us bought sauce in a bottle was only Lea & Perrins®.  Nothing else could be substituted. Less expensive brands never tasted quite right to us.<br /><br />We lovingly placed that bottle with its brown paper cover on the cabinet shelf.  I suppose it would have been fine to remove the paper, but with reverence we kept our ""wooster"" covered.<br /><br />On the special occasions when we ate grilled steak, we thought there was only one steak sauce - Lea & Perrins®.  I have no reason to promote this product.  My comments are not in any way solicited.  I simply want to tell you what tastes good.<br /><br />When I married at a young age, my mother-in-law, Mary, led me into a new adventure of cooking and tasting the wonderful flavors of food.  She cooked the best okra and tomatoes in the world.  Like my family, she could use only one brand of Worcestershire sauce.<br /><br />Mom's Okra And Tomatoes<br />2 medium onions<br />Some olive oil<br />16 ounces frozen sliced okra<br />2 small cans or 1 large can tomatoes<br />2-3 teaspoons Lea & Perrins® Worchestershire sauce<br />¾ cup Heinz® ketchup<br />1 teaspoon sugar or equivalent amount of sugar substitute<br />2 teaspoons vinegar<br />Seasoned salt<br />Black pepper<br />Crushed red pepper<br /><br />Chop the onions into big chunks. Saut&eacute; them in a little olive oil. If the tomatoes are whole, slice them. Add the tomatoes, okra, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, sugar, and vinegar to the onions and olive oil.<br /><br />Bring the mix to a boil and season to taste with seasoned salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper. Don't add extra sugar, which would ruin the taste; do add extra ketchup if you need it.<br /><br />Simmer the mixture until the okra is cooked enough. It should be firm, not mushy. Check the seasoning and add more as needed, but don't get started eating it. You won't have enough to serve.<br /><br />NOTE:  This recipe is copied from my cookbook, Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook",5
B0005XO2ME,"I had always bought Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce because I thought it was the original and the best.  Unfortunately, upon reading the ingredients label, I noticed that Lea & Perrins uses high fructose corn syrup.  I seriously doubt that HFCS was part of the original recipe.  I know a lot of people say that HFCS is no different than sugar, but I disagree for two reasons.  First, HFCS is made through a chemical process.  Second, I, like many people, am fructose intolerant.  Some studies show that fructose intolerance is just as common as lactose intolerance.  I can handle a normal amount of natural fructose, but the additional fructose in processed foods leads to digestive problems.<br /><br />Is it really worth tarnishing the reputation of this classic product by using HFCS?  How much does this actually save per bottle?  I bet less than a penny.  If they are willing to cut corners on this ingredient, how can the rest of the ingredients be trusted?<br /><br />Because of Lea & Perrins cost cutting, I have switched to French's Worcestershire Sauce.  They use molasses and regular corn syrup, not HFCS.",1
B0005XO2ME,"My name never carried well across the neighborhood to the yard where I most often struck out at the plate. Sound, as is the case with many a young boy, was only one way to call me.<br /><br />Misty evenings, just as the sun committed to drop westward, an hour after my father would drive up in his Buick Special, I smelled Worcestershire sauce from our charcoal Webber. This meant the Whiffle ball game ended, and, win or lose, I had a different plate to step up to.<br /><br />The scent created a state of emergency. Bats, balls, and, if we used any, bases were gathered by their respective owners, and we all ran home like lovers impassioned in lustful want.<br /><br />His recipe for steak was simple. Get it from Jerry, a butcher he knew for years, dazzle it with ground pepper and the smallest sprinkle of Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce. Like smoke signals, the air became the messenger, or, for me, a siren seducing me homeward. No other sauce would do. His reasons had no merit for me at six years old, but I never had cause to question.<br /><br />Such as it will be for you. Big bottles of Worcestershire sauce will be what you need, but a small bottle will be inspiration enough.<br /><br />--Brockeim",5
B0005XO2ME,"The people giving this a low rating are rating it based on ONE INGREDIENT, not the product itself.  Look up some of their other reviews, they're for all the Lea & Perrins sauce, and they all say the same thing.  They should do the amazon community a favor and write real reviews, and AMAZON should stop this kind of crap.<br /><br />I don't like how everything has HFCS in it myself, but I'm not going to give a can of Pepsi a 1 star rating over it just because I wish it was made with real sugar.<br /><br />This is the best worcestershire sauce I've found, I use it for a marinade for my beef jerky.  I've tried other sauces, but this has the perfect balance of flavor.",5
B001BKR5L0,"We used to have two pomeranians - Autumn and Teddie.  Ever since we lost Teddie last summer, Autumn became very depressed and wouldn't eat.  We tried so many different brands including home-cooked, he would only ate a couple times and wouldn't touch it anymore.  He lost so much weight and got us so worried.  But that all changed when we found Organix and that's the only brand Autumn will eat.  Now he can't wait until I feed him every morning.  The cost Amazon offered is less expenisve than other retailers and you can't beat free shipping!!  Please continue carrying it!!",5
B001BKR5L0,"I have an old, soppy Saint Bernard who's missing a bunch of her teeth.  And don't start nagging me about doggy dental care!  I adopted her from a rescue organization & the damage had already been done when we got her.  Anyway, we started supplementing her dry kibble with this canned food; and although she really likes it & the consistency is great for her toothlessness, the price increases EVERY TIME we order have left me seeking other options.<br /><br />After weighing out all the costs, it's actually cheaper to buy ground beef in bulk & boil it up for her, and mix it up with some brown rice and/or eggs.  I don't know if this diet is ""healthier"" for her, but she isn't gaining any extra weight & her coat looks fantastic.  And I have peace of mind in knowing ~exactly~ what she's eating.  She's almost 10 & probably doesn't have a whole lot of time left with us, and she seems to prefer the hamburger/brown rice/egg concoction to the canned food.  And my budget likes having a couple of extra dollars a week, too.<br /><br />I really do think it's a great food.  Just make sure you do your own cost calculations to find the best value for your already-stretched dollar.",3
B001BKR5L0,My 3 chihuahuas LOVE this food!  They have been enjoying it for about 8 months now. Their coats are amazing!  When I took them to the vet the other day she thought I had just bathed them but it had been weeks since a bath. I just make sure to give them crunchy treats for their teeth. I feel good knowing they are not eating a bunch of garbage.,5
B001BKR5L0,"My sister told me about Organix brand dog food.  After reading the ingredients I began buying it for my dogs.  I only feed them premium dog foods like Organix and Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers' Soul.  They contain real meat products and no fillers.  Organix takes this a step further with organic food in the ingredients.  The price is a bit higher, but it's worth it to have healthy pets!  My last dog died of cancer, and after a lot of research, I believe that high-quality pet food ingredients without fillers are the best plan for healthier pets!",5
B001BKR5L0,"This is a little pricey, but well worth it.  I figure spend more on the food now, and less on vet bills later from Cancer and other side effects of harmful things in their food.  It's all natural, always well packed. . . sometimes there are a few cans that are dented in the case, but ""such is life"" . . .<br /><br />the chihuahua's love it, even my cat eats it now, (he's 23 years old and won't eat any cat food I buy anymore - ... so I figure he can eat what he likes at this age)<br /><br />It is all natural and organic, free range, hormone free, no grains. . . just wonderful.",5

I'm reticent to feed the food<br />from the dented cans, so end up throwing them away.  Any<br />savings I gained ordering from Amazon were lost in<br />the cans I had to dispose of.

I have two 70 pound Goldendoodles, one with bilateral hip dysplasia.  I have fed them various food over the past five years and none seem to agree with them more than this Castor & Pollux.  One of my dogs has terrible gastric problems with gurgling and passing gas and he hasn't experienced any of that eating this food.  I'm glad to be able to get it on Amazon. Saves me a lot of money compared to the pet store where I was buying it.",5
B001BKR5L0,The 4 stars ONLY because it did not agree with my toy poodle. She loves this BUT it gives her gas so we had to discontinue it.  Was pleased with the quality of it and the good ingredients. It is a great product.,4
B001BKR5L0,"I've tried other foods in the past, but I have never gotten such a positive reation from my husky like I did with this food! I usually mix it with with dry food and she eats it all! In the past she would only lick up a majority of the canned food and would leave the dry, but with just 2 table spoons of this product is enough to have her finish everything every time!",5
B001BKR5L0,"No filler ingredients, could be dryer but the water content not really a big enough problem to deduct a star.",5
B001BKR5L0,"We all love this food. Real meat that my dog loves, and doesn't smell like other canned foods. This food has played a part in improving our dog's health, serving along with Organix dry food, we have been able to provide softer food and more fiber to our dogs senior diet needs.",5
B001BKR5L0,"My dog loves this brand of canned dog food.  I used to cook for her but lately, due to unfortunate circumstances, I do not have the time.  This food has been great for us!  My dog eats this and then looks at me like ""give me more please""  haha...  Also It was really fast shipping.  I signed up for auto ship to get one every month.

I ended up giving a can to a friend and her dog had horrible breath (from his stomach--does not have bad teeth). I didn't give the rest away, will throw it away. I emailed the company twice and they couldn't  bother to respond in about two weeks. Apparently they don't stand by their products. Now I don't trust any of their products even though my dog does fine on the dry formula.",1
B001EQ4E3I,"This ""no sugar added"" version of Nesquik has significantly less sugar in it than the regular Nequik product. It tastes good and a little bit goes a long way to adding chocolate flavor to an average cup of milk so a cannister lasts quite a while. If you want to treat yourself or your kids to chocolate milk once in a while without promoting tooth decay and other problems related to high sugar content, this is the product to buy.",5
B001EQ4E3I,I prefer to buy Nesquik's sugar-free but my store didn't always carry it and amazon's price was great.  I saved about $.70 per container with the case I bought.  Sure I may have enough for a year but that's ok because now I don't worry about running out.  My only issue is that the sugar-free one does not dissolve as fast.  I usually heat the milk first.,4
B001EQ4E3I,"I love quik and I am so glad they have a low sugar version, this takes awhile to mix and does settle easily but it tastes like regular quik to me.",5
B001EQ4E3I,"I have used NSA Nesquik in my coffee for YEARS. It dissolves completely in the hot fluid and tastes great. I can't tell the difference from the fully sugared product.<br /><br />I was looking to buy it in bulk, since it is a staple in my house. None that I found qualifies for Super Saver Shipping.<br /><br />When considering the cost of shipping it is about two dollars MORE per container than even the local Albertson's. Anything under $5/unit would be worth it. Walmart sells it for about $4.75.<br /><br />Bottom line...Keep an eye out, but watch those shipping costs!",3
B001EQ4E3I,This product was suddenly hard to find at the local grovery stores and I was glad to see I could get it at Amazon. It arrived pretty fast with free shipping and is pretty fresh tasting with an expiration date well off into the next year. I'm pretty happy.,5
B001EQ4E3I,"I like chocolate milk but can do without the extra sugar that usually entails by using Sugar Free Nesquick.  Since this product is not always carried in the supermarkets in our area, it made sense to order some from Amazon and have a supply on hand.  The price seems comparable to what I have paid in the supermarket.",5
B001EQ4E3I,"My fave chocolate milk mix, have no idea why it's not available at Target anymore??? Thanks Amazon for having it!",5
B001EQ4E3I,"Why can't I get this in a supermarket?  It's great.  Low cal add-in to a vanilla or unflavored protein shake, use it to make chocolate milk or hot chocolate.  Package of 4 small plastic containers.",5
B001EQ4E3I,"My favorite chocolate milk powder since i was a kid, this non-sugar version tastes just as good as when it has sugar. Definitely a good way to save your teeth, especially when you can drink a whole gallon of milk and maybe more on a hot day with Nesquik at your side.<br /><br />i remember buying the bunny shaped bins of this years ago, i wish they still had them(at least they don't here not sure of other areas). The bins(even if they are not bunny shaped) are recycle friendly you can give one or two of them to your kids to put their crayons or ''Treasures'' in, and you can blue bin them which is another plus.",5

B001EQ4E3I,"I decided to buy the ""no sugar added"" version of this product because I just noticed that my local grocery store offered it. I expected this version of the product to not taste very good or to have a weird aftertaste. On the contrary, chocolate milk made with ""no sugar added"" Nesquik tastes better than the regular version. It has more chocolate flavor than the regular product and my daughter says that this version is ""more powerful"". This is likely why my daughter uses less of the product in her milk. (We make chocolate milk about 2x month, which makes it just an occasional drink for us, so she always used more than the ""recommended serving"" in her glass of milk. Haven't we all?)<br /><br />Perhaps the product has been reformulated since the previous reviews were made that mentioned the chalkiness of the product or the extra effort to dissolve it, but I have not encountered either. If anyone remembers the PDQ product from the 1970s, the Nesquik ""no sugar added"" version has a similar appearance because the product forms balls and chips instead of the perfectly sandy/dusty appearance of regular Nesquik. Nevertheless, I found the ""no sugar added"" version dissolved just as easily as regular version and it doesn't seem chalky at all. Given that this version costs less, has less sugar and fewer calories and is ""more powerful"", I will not buy the regular version again. Why would I? I hope no one at Nestle just read that.",5
B001EQ4E3I,"This tastes good without adding as many empty calories. It doesn't mix in as well as my daughter's pink milk, but I attribute that to the extra starches that are part of splenda.",5
B001EQ4E3I,"this has a chalky flavor compared to the sugar-added counterparts.  Otherwise, the chocolate flavor is acceptable.",3
B001EQ4E3I,"Nesquick No Sugar Added mix is a welcome treat for me since becoming a Type 2 diabetic. It tastes very close to regular chocolate milk or hot chocolate, but has significantly less carbs. That being said, you do have to watch out for the carbs that milk adds to the 7g that is in the Nesquick.<br /><br />Great tasting - Highly Recommended",5

B001EQ4E3I,"Have been drinking hot chocolate every morning for years, by far Quik is the best and no sugar added makes it that much better.",5
B001EQ4E3I,"The reason I purchased this product is for the ""No Sugar Added"" clause. I am annoyed with all the sugar that is added in almost everything. Every kids cocoa drink has too much sugar added. After I tasted my first drink, it felt  too sweet and had an after taste. The taste of an artificial sweetener. After checking the ingredients, I noticed it contains ""Sucralose"". According to Wikipedia, Sucralose is 600 sweeter than table sugar! What's the point of buying something that has no sugar added but adding something that's tons of times sweeter? I am not going after the calorie factor. So does Nesquick add 600 times less amount of Sucralose than sugar to get the same sweetness? I don't think so.<br /><br />Another major problem is that Amazon's ingredients section does NOT mention Sucralose. It mentions Aspartame which, according to Wikipedia, it's 100-150 times sweeter than sugar, which means much less sweeter than Sucralose. So did Nesquick change their ingredients and Amazon did not update their ingredients list?",1
B001EQ4E3I,"The shipping was very slow and the raccoons came In the house and tore open the packages and ate It all, I did Not even know raccoons like Chocolate.",1
B0013M07PW,I take a few of these with me whenever traveling.  They are very tasty and filling.  Great for a small breakfast or snack when there are no gluten free options available.,5
B0013M07PW,"The main virtue these bars have is that they are useful snacks that don't tempt me to eat them up when I don't need them.  Bites with dried cranberries (maybe 3 to a bar) in them taste good enough - otherwise they taste like puffed rice drowned in syrup, which is pretty much what they are.  I prefer almost any of the other gluten-free bars I've tried - Gluten-Free Cafe lemon sesame bars, Larabars (all of them - especially apple pie), Kind fruit and nut bars, etc.  But these aren't terrible - and unlike the other bars named, they don't tempt me to snack on them when I'm at home and other food is available, which means I have them available for road trips when I need them.",3
B0013M07PW,"We love Bakery on Main gluten free products. Can't wait to try more of there products. I do wish it was sold in most stores though. I have to drive a good distance to get it, but it is worth the drive.",5
B0013M07PW,"For somebody that struggles because of diet restrictions, these bars are wonderful! Easy to take where ever I go, and the texture doesn't taste like it's ""GF"" at all!",5
B0013M07PW,I love taking these when we go hiking. They provide a great pick me up and I don't have to worry about my kids being drained by eating a crappy snack. We all love these ones but I tend to sneak one as a late night snack as well. By far the best in my opinion.,5
B0013M07PW,I love these! I keep them in my desk at work so I can have a quick snack when I need it. Sometimes they work for breakfast too when I'm in a hurry in the morning. Great product!!!,5
B0013M07PW,Thanks Bakery on Main for making Gluten Free snacks! This is a tasty one!  I usually snack on one around 3pm.  Perfect!  Wish it didn't have soy though.,4
B0013M07PW,"When I first tried these, I could not stop eating them! I had to get more, they were so good!! I never knew GF or granola could taste so amazing! You will not regret ordering these delicious bars! So much flavour and just the right amount of sweet!",5
B0013M07PW,These are a great snack and the whole family loves them. I keep some in my purse for the kids when they get hungry and they are make for a healthy yummy treat!!,5
B0013M07PW,"I liked the trail mix bar better than the PB chocolate chip bars that Bakery on Main makes but they still have the problem of being too sweet.  Is it possible to make a bar that doesn't cause your blood sugar to sky rocket (and crash)?  All of this being said, I still enjoyed my bars.",4
B0013M07PW,"Everything Bakery on Main makes is delicious and this in no exception! Tastes healthy and delicious! Just the right amount of nuts, dried fruit, and seeds!",5
B0013M07PW,I love these bars because they are nice and crunchy.  I have had other brands that are made with mostly dates and they just do not have that crunch that I like when eating granola bars.,5
B0013M07PW,This is the perfect snack when driving.  It really helps you keep cool in heavey traffic.  I like the fact it is healthy and tasty ready to enjoy.,5
B0013M07PW,"These bars hold together better and are loaded with healthy ingredients,very filling.  They are a better texture than some of the other granola bar flavors, but I could do without the ""syrupy"" taste.",3
B0013M07PW,"The Bakery On Main Extreme Trail Mix Gluten Free Granola Bar is made with certified gluten free oats, amaranth & quinoa. They are full of fruit & seeds, and nuts. They are a little sticky and sweeter than I might really enjoy, but they are filling and great for on the go. (Also, usually the really natural bars (especially ones with nuts) cause break-outs on my face. I was just waiting for it to happen- and it DIDN'T.)",4
B0013M07PW,these little bars are packed with lots of nuts! my main criticism is that more of them should come in one box!,5
B0013M07PW,This is my fav granola bar produced by bakery on main. It's even better than it's granola couterpart (and I think that's awesome too).  Love it!,5
B0013M07PW,"I agree with the other poster who said they're syrupy, but filling. I thought these bars were a bit too sweet and sticky for the flavor they were going for, but they're still very good. Maybe instead of so much sugar they could add more fruit pieces or something that would balance the sweetness out. They are still a great on the go or after the gym snack.",4
B0013M07PW,"My 8 1/2 and 13 1/2 year old children don't often get gluten free pancakes nor gluten free cereal when we are on the road, vacationing, and the Extreme Trail Mix is a great quick, filling, on the go breakfast!  It is a little sweet, but tasty, and they love the flavor!  I love the great, healthy ingredients -- sunflower seds, flax seeds, sesame seeds, coconut, raisins, cranberries almonds, and other nuts.  It fills them up and keeps them going until the next meal!",4
B001CCXVPQ,"My mistake for not spotting the word, ""flavored,"" but this is really awful! I was expecting Blue Mountain coffee and instead got this foul tasting coffee-like brew that has no coffee taste at all. Is it hazelnut? I hope not - I have nut allergies. Whatever it is, it overpowers any weak coffee flavor that may have been present at the beginning!<br /><br />Checking the ingredients on the package, we learn that it includes Arabica coffee and ""natural and/or artificial flavors."" Digging around the Wolfgang Puck website, we first learn that it's ""Light flavored coffee with the essence of the islands (Flavored)"" and finally, ""Coconut Infusion Flavored Coffee.""<br /><br />I never would have guessed coconut.",1
B001CCXVPQ,"I love this coffee from Wolfgang Puck, it is always fresh, tasty and provides a consistent cup of java, one cup at a time.<br /><br />Best of all, you can taste the flavors that make Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee so famous. Of course, it is not 100% Blue Mountain, but a respectable blend of arabica beans that includes enough of that treasured bean to justify its name. And it is neither under nor over roasted, just done to the point where the flavors are best.",5
B001CCXVPQ,"I bought this for use in my Bunn pod brewer, and since I am unable to buy these pods at the local supermarket, I took a chance at buying a 54 unit package without having tasted the product before.  Just opening the pouch releases a pleasant and sweet aroma.  This coffee is light and balanced, with low acidity.  I quickly went through the first 18 count box.",4
B001CCXVPQ,"Jamaica Me Crazy is my new favorite. The aroma alone makes me smile. Unlike most flavored coffees, the taste delivers too. Awesome coffee!",5
B001CCXVPQ,Great tasting coffee.  I use two pods because I like it strong.  Pods fit Senseo coffee maker perfectly.,5
B001CCXVPQ,"When I attempted to return this item upon finding it would not work in a Keurig, I was especially disappointed to see that I could not return even the second unopened box.",2
B001CCXVPQ,"This has become one of our favorite Keurig flavors. The taste is very smooth and the coconut flavor is not over-powering. We drink our coffee black, and some of the flavored coffees have a strong, almost bitter after-taste when cream and sugar aren't used. This one doesn't have that after-taste. I'm on my 4th reorder, and have started buying the larger boxes so I don't have to do without it.",5
B001CCXVPQ,I have tried other pods and have noticed the added flavors are over-powering and leave a chemical after-taste. The pods without the added flavors taste great. I am a pod fan.,1
B001CCXVPQ,"I got this 3 pack because I LOVE Jamaica me Crazy K-cups (which is what I thought these would be). But, regardless, when they arrived and I realized they were pods I thought ""Oh well, I can still use them in my Kurig.""... But these taste nothing like the K-cups! I mean, NOTHING. ...dirty water. I can't imagine any kind of single cup brewer somehow magically making these things taste good.",1
B001CCXVPQ,wolfgang puck jamaica me crazy coffee makes my mother crazy about coffee so i buy it for her all the time and the best deal for these coffee pods has been on amazon so this is where i get them...good coffee...good price and free ship with amazon...glenn,5
B001CCXVPQ,I was also expecting something more akin to the Green Mountain 'Island Coconut' coffee - an aromatic coffee that tastes like coconut - this is NOT remotely close. Doesn't smell or taste very good and the coconut flavor or smell is almost non-existent. Don't waste your money.,1
B001CCXVPQ,"I received a new coffee maker and  it has the option to use these coffee pods in the single serving side of the machine..Well decided to try a few varieties to see what might be good and what my guests might enjoy.<br /> Well I am blown away at HOW GOOD this variety, Jamaica Me Crazy tastes... I am not usually a fan of flavored coffee's but this is just enough of a light coconut flavor and scent to make it a nice variation .. This is particularly pleasant as a after dinner dessert coffee with a light amt of cream.. No sugar is really need.. I like the light sweet smell  that my cup of coffee give me . Such a pleasant experience..<br />  I will definitely be getting more of this variety and it also inspires me to want to try some others that Wolfgang Puck has as well..",5
B001CCXVPQ,"This was very good coffee, enjoy the pod style coffee makers the best. Quick and easy no mess to clean up after.",5
B001CCXVPQ,"This coffee was a dollar more than most, but I love coconut flavored coffee and just had to pay the price for ""Jamaica Me"" to give it a try!<br /><br />I""m so glad I tried it! It is without a doubt the best K cup of coffee I've ever tried.",5
B001CCXVPQ,"Description said flavored, but what kind of flavor?  I purchased, and I did not like the flavor: it had a cinnamon taste to it.  Description should mention the flavor to expect.  Hawaiian hazelnut is very good and subtle.  Works great with my Senseo",2
B001CCXVPQ,"I thought I was ordering K-cups since I found this listing in an Amazon e-mail to me about K-cups. The mistake was unfortunate and Amazon made it right by issuing an immediate refund. I just wish I could have found a way to use the ""pods"" in my Keurig machine because Wolfgang Puck Jamiacan Me Crazy is my favorite coffee of all.  Thank you Amazon for being the best online merchant of all.",4
B001CCXVPQ,"I bought these coffee ""Pods"" to use in my Keurig. Now discover that these are differenct ""Pods"". Amazon wont't take them back. I am stuck.",1
B001CCXVPQ,"I did not know there was a difference between ""pods"" and K cup coffee.  Very disappointed in the description.  Again, THESE ARE NOT K CUPS!!",1
B001CCXVPQ,This was also Hazelnut just like the K-Cups. This wasn't in the description and smelled awful. It was Wolfgang me crazy.,1
B001HTE5L8,"I was looking for something healthy to replace my horrible addiction to soda. One day at my college, Steaz Iced Teaz were being put into a new healthy vending machine. I asked to try the Blueberry, Pomegranate & Acai flavor because the gentleman said it was his best seller. I certainly know why! The taste is great, it is a very refreshing drink and it has less than half of the calories, carbs, and sodium as a soda. I love this stuff and now I make sure to have it in my house at all times. When I'm going to leave, I bring some with me. I highly recommend Steaz Iced Teaz.",5
B001HTE5L8,"We are overdosing on high sugar (especially high fructose corn syrup, which is bad for your health) foods these days. Americans are experiencing record epidemics with diabetes and obesity. It's about time some companies are coming out with low, or lower sugar beverages (or in this case, with cane juice) to give people a fighting chance with their health. I am also thankful that this product does not contain any artificial sweeteners (which are also bad for your health; please read 'Sweet Deception' by Dr. Joseph Mercola- a phenomenal book). This iced tea tastes very good, without too much sugar overpowering the tea flavor. Excellent product!",5
B001HTE5L8,Let me start by saying that this is an absolutely fantastic iced tea.  Full of flavor and antioxidants!  Give it a try - only 80 Calories for the entire can!  (40 cals/serving).,5
B001HTE5L8,"I don't know what other teas people are drinking for this review, but for me there is no aftertaste.  It has just the right amount of sugar without being overly sweet.  You really taste the blueberry flavor.  I have stopped drinking sodas and have gone to drinking Steaz teas.  The peach and lime-pomogranate are very good as well.  Try picking one up at  your local grocery store to see if you like it, then go to Amazon and buy by the 12 pack for a better deal.",5
B001HTE5L8,This tie was some what good but left a bad after tasted. I gave it three star's as that it was not so bad as to make me want to not drink it.,3
B001HTE5L8,Cans came super dented and messed up but I didn't care about that. The tea tastes like water and sweet n' low with raspberry syrup. Cheap and a decent drink to give guests you don't need to impress but over all not even worth the $1 per can.,3
B001HTE5L8,"I find that most pre-bottled teas are too sugary and for that reason I decided to try these Steaz.  The amount of sugar in these is pretty close to perfect BUT there is barely any flavor in this tea.  Tastes like water with a slight hint of some blueberry taste.  I could understand lowering the sugar but with no flavor I might as well drink bottled water.  ALso the top of every can is stained with spilled tea and covered with dirt, kinda gross and a pain in the ass to have to wash it off before you drink each one.",2
B001HTE5L8,"I was conflicted as to how I was going to rate this item. The product is excellent. No complaints. But I was buying them at $12.66 for a 12 pack, now its about $26 for a 12 -pack. That's super pricey.",4
B001HTE5L8,"My son, who is very picky, loves this drink. I like it because it is not full of sugar and has no sugar substitutes.",5
B001HTE5L8,"These teas are natural, low in sugar and this is the best price you can get them! Dont think twice. They are amazing, so is each and lemon flavors!",5
B001HTE5L8,"sooooooo good.<br /><br />I love this stuff! not too sweet, just perfect. The Tea came in a jiffy, a 12 pack that cost me about $12 - which is cheap, considering I normally pay $2 each at my local grocer.  The ingredients are great and it is a genuinely good product.",5
B001HTE5L8,Great flavor! Good for afternoon pick-me up. I think this is the best Steaz flavor -- but some of the others ones are good as well.<br /><br />I subscribe to monthly shipments -- easier and cheaper than picking it up at the store.,5
B001HTE5L8,"I love this stuff!  I'm not a big water drinker I hate to admit.  This tea is a great alternative to pop, juice, etc.  It's not too sweet-just right-so I don't feel bad drinking it.  Flavor is refreshing and not overpowering.",5
B001HTE5L8,"Great taste, good ingredients.  I like it (and I'm picky).  Order came quickly and just about to order some more.",5
B001HTE5L8,"Don't know if its my tastebuds or the taste the drink, but I hate it.  It has a bad taste, like it was sweetened with an artificial sweetener.",1
B001HTE5L8,"The first time I ordered this was to just see if it would be a healthy type drink I could drink every day if I wanted.  I've now been subscribed to it for months.  The drink is very refreshing and has a great taste, all with a reasonable amount of calories.  I am now interested to try other products from Steaz.",5
B001HTE5L8,"I've said the same for the citrus one...I like these.  Nice energy drink replacement.  Not sickly sweet, tastes great, good energy boost!",5
B001HTE5L8,"This one doesnt wow me, but it is tasty and smooth with just enough sweetness. The blueberry/pomegranate blend well and go down easy. Not my favorite Steaz, but definitely still has a place in my fridge. As an aside, this one is my girlfriends favorite, and she gives it five stars, so my household combined ranking would be 4 1/2 stars.<br />Enjoy!",4
B001HTE5L8,"Steaz Blueberry Pomegranate & Acai green ice tea is fantastic.  It's one of my favorite drinks.  I feel like I'm being healthy by drinking this instead of soda, and the calories are low.  Win win.  Only negative is the cost.  I would drink more of it if the price were less expensive.",4
B003TN6FNG,"These are truly delicious, full of nuts, and the Apricot adds the right amount of sweetness and moistness.  I have tried several different KIND bars, and these are by far my favorite!",5
B003TN6FNG,"Small, easy to take along in my purse.  Great for dip in blood sugar.  Keeps well and doesn't melt in warm temps.  Very good tasting.",5
B003TN6FNG,I love the mini kind bars.  Sometimes the full-sized bars are too much and these are just right.  I hope they come out with all of the KIND bar flavors in the minis!,5
B003TN6FNG,"I have been subscribing to this and other Kind products for over a year now, and have noticed that the bars are getting smaller and smaller, but the price keeps creeping up.<br /><br />It have become almost a game when the bars arrive: How much smaller are the bars going to be since the previous consignment of 3 months ago?  Maybe I should keep one from each shipment and compare its length when the next arrives.<br /><br />Of course the wrapper remains the same size, and that just adds to the fun.  I wonder if the bar will ever reduce to half the wrapper size.<br /><br />Apart from all this, the quality of the bars themselves has remained consistent, but the freshness varies from shipment to shipment.",2
B003TN6FNG,"It was my mistake that I did not recognize that these were mini bars.  They are maybe half the size of the bar you find in the store.  I paid $17 for 20 bars.  I now see that they are $25 for the same amount.  unless you need the small bars, i would not recommend buying these.",1
B003TN6FNG,"I ORDERED 4 BOXES OF 5 KIND MINI BARS AND RECEIVED ONLY 4 MINI BARS IN A ZIP LOCK BAG CALLED PACK OF 4. LUCKILY, AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS ABLE TO REFUND MY DEFECTIVE ITEM.

THE FOUR KIND MINI BARS I RECEIVED ARE BENT AND NOT AT ALL APPETIZING  UNLIKE THE DELICIOUS KIND MINI BARS I HAVE ENJOYED IN THE PAST.

B003TN6FNG,Those fruits and nuts and chewy stuff that hold it all together is a great combo. Addicting. Healthy and gluten-free.....YAY!,5
B003TN6FNG,Not as good as the almond and coconut.... but still yum!  I love the texture and how clean the kind items are.  I typically use these before and after my workouts.,3
B003TN6FNG,"If you like apricots or peaches this is the energy bar for you.It is completely natural, tasty, not overtly sweet and<br />the minis are a prefect dessert or snack size.Buying it on Amazon is the best deal I found for these especially with the subscribe and save option.<br />In grocery stores you are paying close to $22 for the same box.",4
B003TN6FNG,"I ordered the Fruit & Nut mini bars expecting to receive 20 individual mini bars since the description says 5 count pack of 4. However, as some other reviews indicated, what they actually ship you is 1 count pack of 4 - meaning 4 mini bars for the price of $22.xx. I contacted Amazon and they said they could not ""fix"" the problem but would offer me a full refund instead.<br /><br />If you are interested in these bars, order the regular size instead (as I did). They seem to be shipping correctly.",2
B003TN6FNG,I thought cranberry was my fav til I tasted these. Magnificent! Tastes like tropical paradise and very filling. Keeps my from passing out when blood-sugar low. Love that its made with honey.,5
B003TN6FNG,"Be aware, this seller is only fulfilled thru Amazon, not an Amazon product.

I used to love another brand of bar that is more ""processed"" and now that I've been eating these more ""real food"" items I can barely stand the old stuff.  I love the apricot and the cranberry.  Great food.",5
B003TN6FNG,These are the very best...but the boxes only contained 4 bars and appeared to have been carefully opened to allow one bar to be removed.  Please check your delivery if you purchase.,4
B003TN6FNG,"kind almond & apricot bars are a 5 star product. But this mini pack is just too $$$ not worth the price, i would just buy the normal size 12 pack.",3
B003TN6FNG,This is by far my favorite flavor of the Kind Bars!  Great Gluten Free snack when you're on the go!  Delicious!,5
B003TN6FNG,"I've tried a LOT of snack bars. As I become more nutrition-conscious (and wary of additives and HFCS), I have become more particular. And as always, there is the matter of taste.<br /><br />At this point, Kind bars are all I use. Everything else pales in quality, nutrition, and taste.<br /><br />Buying from REI in >12qty gets a 20% discount, about a buck-sixty each net, but Amazon (with free shipping) is still better, near a buck-and-a-quarter.<br /><br />Good for between-meal staying power, bike rides, hikes, emergency car/RV stash. They last on the shelf longer than I have been able to wait to eat them; I can't tell the difference between new bars and > 3-month-old ones from my stash. The dried-fruit content and lower-oil nuts seem to keep them naturally preserved.<br /><br />I definitely do not like the ones with peanuts in them, but that's a personal taste matter.",5
B003TN6FNG,"Good taste and just the right size, these nutritous gluten free treats are convenient to throw into a carry on bag and snack on anywhere, anytime. They are not messy, nor do they melt, so they travel well year-round.",5
B0098C6AKK,The coffee is very good compared to Maxwell drip and reasonably good compared to other Tassimo brands. This is my standard morning coffee. No complaints for the cost!,5
B0098C6AKK,"I have purchased these T discs many times and there is something wrong with this last order.  Does anyone else have the problem of the discs only making 3/4 of a cup?  It's not my machine because any other brand turns out fine.  I bought another package from a retail store and the same thing is happening!  For the money that these discs cost, this is unacceptable.  I bought a whole case!!!",3
B0098C6AKK,the coffee is good. but I've been trying to cancel the auto shipments but its impossible to find any way for customer service to help. therefore they continue sending it and I have to keep sending it back.,5
B0098C6AKK,This is still good coffee but they have DOUBLED the cost.  Half the price at BBB with a 20 percent coupon.  Also available half what Amazon is now charging @ Target & Walmart (at least it was available there a couple month ago),1
B0098C6AKK,"For anyone who simply wants a basic, American-style cup of coffee, this is perfectly fine. No, it's not as full-flavored or (arguably) as good as most of the higher priced Tassimo offerings, but it isn't intended to be. This is a simple, inexpensive cup for everyday use.<br /><br />That said, I knocked off a star due to Amazon's current pricing. The unit price for the ""Friday Sale"" is roughly the same as the individual retail price at many stores. That's not a deal -- and certainly doesn't represent the sort of discount one would expect to receive when buying a 5-pack.",4
B0098C6AKK,The coffee is excellent the price great. After my K cup took a dive I gave the T-disc a try Wow. It was better than any of the K-cup brands I had. The only unfortunate draw back is you can't seem to get the T-disc in stores. Good thing Amazon has them at a good price.,4
B0098C6AKK,I enjoy this coffee.  Biggest problem is that it overfills my mugs so that I have to watch it so as not to overflow. I don't understand why some brands overflow and some do not fill the cup.,4
B0098C6AKK,"I was surprised at the pleasant flavor of this coffee. Robust enough to satisfy, with a great smooth, full taste. One of my regular favorites for the Tassimo.",5
B0098C6AKK,This coffee is just the right strength for me.  It has no bitter aftertaste.  I love it! Great price with the save & subscribe feature and it comes right to you.,5
B0098C6AKK,"When I come down the stairs in the morning, and the kids are ""making coffee"" I smell the great aroma of the original Maxwell House coffee that I grew up with. When I get to the kitchen, I have a great cup of coffee, with no mess and no waste. The coffee disc's are expensive, but there is no ""day old"" coffee left sitting in the pot. This coffee is nothing fancy, not too strong, and taste good every time I fix a cup.",5
B0098C6AKK,These discs and the Tassimo coffee machine are incredibly easy to use and Amazon ships the discs in record time.,5
B0098C6AKK,"There is nothing really special about these t-discs coffee. It's not very strong, but it does radiate a fresh roasty flavor when brewed. This is definitely the most convenient way for me to brew coffee while in the office where I don't want to deal with the mess of coffee beans.",5
B0098C6AKK,This is a great tasting product and it is much cheaper than others. You can't beat it in any way. I drank many other coffees including Starbucks and found this to be quite satisfactory.,5
B0098C6AKK,"This Tassimo Maxwell coffee  from the Maxwell Cafe collection<br />is the choice at our house no matter who is choosing! Finally<br />a coffee that My husband, Kids & friends love! This price can't be Beat!",5
B0098C6AKK,Great cafe and a good product.. The most you can get for what you pay for love it . thx,5
B0098C6AKK,"This is great-tasting coffee.  So convenient in the T-Disk format.  When you want just one cup of coffee, just pop one of the T-Disks in your Tassimo and out comes a very good cup.  Maxwell House should be proud.",5
B0098C6AKK,"As the title says, this is a good basic cup of coffee.  We feel a little frustrated by the 6 ounce default pour - does anyone still drink coffee in these lilliputian quantities? Still, with a little time spent pressing the ""give me more"" button, we can get a nice full cup of medium bodied coffee. We generally alternate cups between this and Gevalia Vanilla Hazelnut on the weekends.",4
B0098C6AKK,The brand of coffee is a nice medium brew.  I don't like coffee that is too bold or strong and this fits the bill.,5
B0098C6AKK,"Do you remember what it smells like to add water to an ashtray full of cigarettes? That's how this coffee tastes. I added a caramel, some hazelnut flavoring, a packet of hot chocolate with miniature marshmellows, and Coffeemate vanilla chai creamer too it. It still tasted bitter, like wet cigarettes and metallic. I think the metallic flavor comes from the t-disc packaging. It doesn't make sense to buy a $100 coffee maker and drink trashy coffee. Especially when you can take that same amount of cash and buy some good coffee. I ignored the bad ratings of other reviewers because I believed the positive reviews. The only redeeming factors are that it is cheaper (less than $7 at Walmart), and that you can make a single cup of coffee. If it were allowed, I'd give it a -5 rating (or &lt;-> -,  for infinitly horrible).",1
B002ATCFX4,"This sauce is made with the hottest pepper in the world. It's named the Naga Jolokia but its' nickname is the Indian Ghost Pepper. I love spicy and I can handle things pretty hot but this sauce really surprised me. The taste is amazing. It's a very unique, heavy flavor that expands and keeps developing and changing in your mouth. Its just delicious. But the heat expands too. I've been putting a minuscule dash on my burgers and other things just to warm things up. So good but really, really, really, really hot.",5
B002ATCFX4,"I try new hot sauces as often as possible and Melinda's has done it again with this particular sauce. It probably goes without saying that this is extremely hot, but what is impressive is that there is an equal amount of flavor. As other reviewers have pointed out, there is a significant difference between a sauce that is just simply chemically hot with extracts and concentrations of capsaicin and one that is naturally hot without the chemical bitter taste you get with some other sauces.<br /><br />Long story short, this sauce is packed with flavor and certainly packed with heat, it isn't the 'hottest in the world' but if the novelty of insane sauce heat has worn off and you're looking for a flavorful heat, this is for you.",5
B002ATCFX4,"Melinda's hot sauces are the best out there. Very flavorful and reasonably priced. I eat allot of hot sauces and got to tell you all this is one HOT sauce. What is amazing is that there are no ""hot pepper extracts"" in this. All natural ingredients. There are some flavors that remind me of the Habanero pepper, but this sauce is in another galaxy as far as heat is concerned. I will need to dilute it down or mix it in some BBQ sauce or something, it is that hot. Putting a dime sized drop on a sandwich was tasty at first then the heat comes, and keeps coming. My mouth and tounge hurt for many minutes afterwards, then came the endorphin rush and all was well. Bottom line, if your looking for an all natural hot sauce that is truely hot, look no further.",5
B002ATCFX4,"As a self-proclaimed connoisseur of hot sauces, I would have to say that Melinda's Naga Jolokia is my absolute favorite.  While not as hot as some of the other sauces made form the Bhut Jolokia (Ghost Pepper), it definitely has the best flavor of the ones I've tried.  That said, it is still very hot and there have been times my digestive system has hated me for using too much.  As far as Melinda's sauces go, I would consider this one of the best ones, and as a fan of Melinda's, that's pretty good.  As for heat, I would consider Dave's Jolokia sauce a little hotter, but I'd choose this everytime, just because the flavor is better.  But then again, that's just my opinion. Get both and try for yourself...and get that whole milk ready.",5
B002ATCFX4,"This is no run of the mill hot sauce.  It has instantly become my favorite.  The flavor is complex and satisfying, while the heat seems to gradually build to an intense burn that lingers for a few minutes.  This is not for those who can't handle heat, nor is it for the heat junkies that love the ""must sign a waiver to consume"" sauces made with capsaicin extract.  If you are someone who appreciates flavor and heat, Melinda's Naga Jolokia is definitely worth trying.",5
B002ATCFX4,"I have to agree with the other reviews. This sauce is very flavorful and by far the hottest Melinda's will ever be able to make. I love Melinda's because they don't try to destroy you with heat, although this one has some SERIOUS kick to it. They really know how to make a flavorful hot sauce, and this one ties with the 4x Reserve as being my two favorites.",5
B002ATCFX4,"THis sauce lives up to its name and the reputation of the Ghost Pepper.  It's more than merely hot, though, because it has flavor  and<br />when it's used judiciously, will not overpower the taste of the food.  It provides more than augmentation like, say, Tabasco, because the Ghost Pepper is<br />undeniably hot, and if you use it too liberally no doubt it will render your sauce, your sandwich, your potatoes more molten than you may like.<br />But a few drops, strategically placed and swirled around, will give you a short burst of intense heat and a lingering taste that, while hot, makes good food<br />even better.  Highly recommended for pepper devotees.",5
B002ATCFX4,"I think it has a better flavor than the Mad Dog ghost pepper sauce, but it isn't as hot.  So, it all depends on what your looking for.",5
B002ATCFX4,"I've reordered this a few times now and love this hot sauce. It is very hot (ghost chilis and all). But unlike a lot of them out there that are just hot and harsh, this actually has a good flavor to it. Assuming your taste buds survive the heat :)",5
B002ATCFX4,"Like most Melinda's hot sauces, they aren't the hottest around. You CAN find hotter sauces made from the same pepper... but whether you taste the pepper is a different story. What I've noticed with this brand of sauce is that you can actually taste the pepper. Now to this particular sauce... I tried dabs of this sauce on omlets or pizza with no particular note or notice. It seemed no hotter than any other habanero based sauce I've had in the past. All hype.. right?<br /><br />One day I decided to use it for a dipping sauce for french fries... not such a good idea. This sauce is fine in small amounts, you get a good dose of the taste of the pepper. But try to use it like a habanero sauce is a mistake... it's painful. Slow, constant burn really sneaks up on you, just when you think it is not that bad... it's too late. Have respect for the Naga Jolokia!",5
B002ATCFX4,"I really like this hot sauce.  It has excellent flavor and the heat seems to spread through your whole body and stay with you well after you are done eating.  This pepper sauce not only has a unique flavor, it has a unique feel to it.  I'm a fan for life.",5
B002ATCFX4,"I love hot food.LOVE IT! I have finished a bottle of the regular Melinda's and two bottles of the xxxxReserve Habanero Sauce. The Naga Jolokia sauce is hot and delicious.<br /><br />I was suprised that it wasn't hotter. At first I just tried a dash or two but quickly realized that I could handle quite a bit of it.<br /><br />Don't be scared by the name, If you like hot food, you'll like this sauce.",5
B002ATCFX4,"I should of bought two bottles of Melinda's and saved on shipping because I have been putting this delicious sauce on everything.  Not as spicy as I thought it would be, but it taste great with a good burn.  It burns much more than any store bought sauce I have tasted.",5
B002ATCFX4,"This hot sauce is GOOD!<br /><br />I am a chili head with over 30-40 different ""active"" hot sauces and much more used and in storage. This sauce is one of my favorites. The sauce really works off of the heat and flavor of the ghost pepper and does not try to mask it like many other naga jolokia sauces. It is very spicy though and would only recommend to serious chili heads who like a great heat and great flavor.",5
B002ATCFX4,"Don't let the Naga Jolokia title scare you. This hot sauce actually has a decent heat and decent taste.<br /><br />Good:<br /><br /># I enjoyed the taste of it. It doesn't taste like battery acid, unlike some hot sauces.<br /><br /># Medium-to-hot. Won't be unbearable, even if used in a large amount.<br /><br /># Perfect to cook with.<br /><br /># Isn't runny - is actually a paste similar to ketchup.<br /><br /># I like the design of the bottle<br /><br />Can't think of anything neutral or bad to say about this product. I would recommend this to anyone.",5
B002ATCFX4,"I love it - plain and simple.  Melinda's has created the best hot sauce EVER!  Painfully hot and flavorful too - how is this possible?  Ballistic all natural heat and delicious, I'm hooked!",5
B002ATCFX4,"I sought this one out because I like Melinda's and I like that it contains peppers, not extracts.<br /><br />It's good - first jolokia sauce I've tried. I've had a few of Melinda's habanero sauces and like them very much - definitely my favorite brand. But I think Melinda's carrot, etc. blend matches much better with habanero than jolokia - they seemed to clash a little bit. Seems the jolokia overpowered the other flavors rather than blending.<br /><br />Definitely hot. Worth a try. Melinda's fans may be a bit disappointed.",4
B002ATCFX4,"A very good and very hot sauce...a few drops will do.  Not overly hot like the Dave's Insanity where all they use are extracts.  You actually get some flavor with this one.  It does take some getting used to if you are moving up from Habanero sauces...take it a drop at a time until you develop your toloerance. Once you do, you'll not go back!  I started with a couple drops, and now use this as my go-to sauce of choice on eggs, in chili, on my breakfast sandwich....it's just so good.",5
B002ATCFX4,"Ok...my husband had me purchase this sauce as he is a big pepper fanatic and could not wait to try the Naga Jolokia pepper. He was sorely disappointed in this sauce. We live in the Caribbean and are accustomed to really hot peppers, although I personally am not a pepper person.<br /><br />After the first tentative taste of this sauce my husband sighed in disappointment and proceeded to literally drench his food in it to get that ""eye burning, choking"" sensation that apparently all pepper fanatics can't wait to experience.<br /><br />I have not tried the sauce, but he says that in addition to the heat being just mild to moderate, there is not much flavour there. Anyway, heat level is a subjective and relative thing, so as far as my review goes...thumbs down on expected heat and flavour.<br /><br />I think his next step is to try the raw naga jolokia peppers. Good luck to him!<br /><br />I would just like to add to the above review and state that it is now 5 months later and I have since tried the naga jholokia sauce, as my spouse did not seem that impressed. I found it hot and spicy, but nothing that made my eyes water. The heat from the ghost peppers has been tempered with carrots, papaya and passion fruit. Still maintain the 3 star rating.",3
B000FIULB0,"The #7 (""other"" ?!) plastic bowl packaging is supposed to make for microwaving convenience. But I could *taste* that plastic whenever I took a forkful from the edge of the bowl.<br /><br />Should I be concerned about ingesting plastic that is of the ""other"" variety? #7 is often polycarbonate, which is often hardened with BPA, which is under fire. And, of course, #7 has no recycling program.<br /><br />It's hard to know much about the health effects of ""other"" plastic. Using this container for ""heat-and-eat"" convenience sits poorly alongside the vigilance involved in choosing organic food! At any rate, the plastic just tastes bad.<br /><br />I'm still happy to have a case of these at my office so I can make a decent hot lunch without planning ahead -- but I now always dump the contents into a real ceramic bowl, put a small plate over it (to provide a non-airtight lid), and zap it for 60 seconds. (Package recommends 90 seconds, but 60 suffices.) I assume the worst health risk of plastic packaging happens with the microwave heating, and I am happy not to be tasting that ""other"" stuff.<br /><br />Minsley, please give us a #1 or #2 recyclable bowl (or #4 bag, or perhaps a #5 heatable bowl) -- and admit that the convenience is just about vacuum-packing the right quantity of cooked rice with the right moisture for re-heating in a proper container -- and then this will become what it should be.",3
B000FIULB0,I bought these for my vegetarian daughter when she went off to college and she loves them. A quick and healthy meal! I kept a couple for myself and now I am hooked as well.,5
B000FIULB0,"This is the best tasting rice!  Much better than any instant rice, and much better tasting than the sacks of frozen rice at the store.  My husband was very skeptical about my praise of gogo rice -- then I made some for him and he LOVES it.  The microwavable pouch rice in the grocery store has an aftertaste -- this does NOT!  It tastes like it came out of the rice cooker.",5
B000FIULB0,"I am very disappointed and scared.  I love this rice, I love the flavor and the convenience of this product.  However, the forth bowl I cooked in the microwave had a piece of ""GLASS"" in it!!!  Now I am afraid to eat the rest.  I am lucky I did not swallow it!!!  I heard a crunch when I was chewing and spit it out.  To my dismay it was a piece of clear glass!!!  How the **** did a piece of glass get into the rice.  I would really like someone to cantact me regarding this.  I would contact the product maker, but am not sure how to go about doing that.",1
B000FIULB0,"As a college student without access to a full kitchen, these make a great snack.  I eat rice on a daily basis at home and the texture of microwaveable rice feels a little off, but the rice itself tastes fine.",5
B000FIULB0,These are very nice only take a minute and a half on microwave. I have looked at these and they are pretty reasonable in price.,4
B000FIULB0,"I eat a lot of chinese food, and always have leftovers. Since it is nearly impossible to reheat rice, I bring my leftover chicken to work with a bowl of GoGo Steamed Rice. After 90 seconds in the microwave, it tastes like freshly steamed rice. Yummy!",5
B000FIULB0,"Organic, tasty, and right there on the pantry shelf. I love the nutty taste of brown rice but there are those subtle flavors that call for a white rice base. Being a doofus at cooking rice from scratch, I really appreciate having this around to help me out on those occasions.",5
B000FIULB0,"I reheated this out of the plastic bowl--and even reheated in a ceramic bowl, it tastes like, and smells like, plastic; it leaves a bitter/sour plastic aftertaste for quite a while after it's eaten.<br /><br />Scaree.",1
B000FIULB0,"I'm always looking for a quicker way to put together dinner.  Thought this would be a good choice -- 1.5 minutes in the microwave, and you have hot rice ready to serve.<br /><br />Almost.<br /><br />It comes out kind of sticky and gummy.  Taste is OK, but the texture is a little odd. Definitely not ""fluffable.""<br /><br />However -- it TASTES great with a saucy topping of some kind.  Sauce (doesn't seem to matter what kind) seems to ""loosen"" the gumminess, and you end up with individual rice grains.  I've been using it lately to go with my stir-fries, and the sauce seems to cut through the stickiness, leaving a bowl of very nice-tasting rice.  I tried it tonight with a chicken dish and it's great with that, too (3 large chicken breast halves, cut into bite-sized pieces; 2 cans of Sauce Arturo; 1/2 C wine; some chopped onion, sliced ripe olives. Mix sauce, pour over chicken chunks and olive slices in a shallow baking dish, cover and bake at 350 for 40 minutes.)<br /><br />I'll be buying this again, for sure.  I prefer to make rice the ""old fashioned way,"" but this is good when I need something in a hurry.",4
B000FIULB0,"Just like the other reviewer said- as good as from the rice cooker! Or better!<br />Just add a little butter (or margarine) and salt.....mmmmm!<br /><br />This brand of microwaveable rice simply cannot be found in brick & mortar stores (at least not in the Chicago area). I never even heard of it before until I stumbled upon it here- hopefully, Amazon will keep this item, we love it!",5
B000FIULB0,"These are the best! I absolutely love this rice. So convenient, fresh tasting and perfect portion sized. I throw in some veggies & my favorite asian sauce and I have a lunch or dinner ready in 2 minutes.",5
B000FIULB0,"do not recommend this.  rice tastes a little odd, maybe the aluminum preservative, or the plastic -- and after cooking in the microwave the kernels are still kind of hard and brittle.",1
B000FIULB0,"this rice is so good. it's better than I could ever cook, even in a rice maker. it's moist and delicious. it heats up in 1 min 30 sec. it's a good quantity. i put a little soy sauce and sesame seed on it and it's a meal.",5
B000FIULB0,"Love this product!  This is best tasting instant rice out in the market now.  Takes only 90 seconds and your ready to eat.  The one negative that some people have mentioned is that the container is plastic and when you heat the rice in the plastic bowl, the rice does have a plastic taste and smell to it.  An easy way to avoid this is to just remove the rice from the plastic container before heating it.  I usually put the rice in a ceramic bowl then stick it in the microwave.  Problem solved!",5
B000FIULB0,"Pros: organic, fast, convenient, tastes good, relatively inexpensive.<br />Cons: slightly weird texture, plastic taste sometimes, non biodegradable plastic bowl<br /><br />Details:<br />I first ordered this as an alternative to Annie Chun's Sticky rice and am really happy I did so. I find it to be a perfect serving for one person, probably 'cos I am of East Indian origin and rice is a staple for us. It is very convenient and not too expensive either. Especially if you compare it with Annie Chun's sticky rice. It doesn't taste like rice you have made in a rice cooker or in a pot on the stovetop, it tastes like rice made instantly in the microwave. The texture is somewhere between that of sticky rice and regular rice. The only thing I don't like is the plastic bowl it comes in, for two reasons: 1. you can ""taste the plastic sometimes, especially at the bottom and the sides. 2. it goes straight into the landfill. It would be great if they replace the plastic bowl with some sort of natural/biodegradable material. That's the reason I took off one star, otherwise it is a pretty good product for the price. If you are getting it this rice, I'd  suggest doing what I do and what some others here have said, dump the contents in a creamic/glass bowl and follow the instructions on the package to microwave.  Bottom line, it is fast, convenient, organic and tastes pretty good. Put it on subscribe and save and get even better value for money.",4
B000FIULB0,"Great flavor, healthy and tasty, as good as Annies sticky rice but much lower cost<br />walk in the door and 2 minutes later your eating lunch, Cant beat that",5
B000FIULB0,"We thoroughly enjoyed the taste of this rice. The grains were long and smelt excellent. On top, this is organically grown rice so free from chemicals and pesticides. Will buy this rice again :)",4
B000FIULB0,"I love these rice bowls.  Older kids can make them by themselves as snacks, which is mainly what we use them for.  These aren't as sticky as the Annie Chuns (which we love also), but the better price on these makes GoGo Rice our choice.<br />Update 10-01-08:  I'm so disappointed by the rate hike in the case of these bowls!  It used to be such a bargain.  I also think the previous poster has a good point re: heating in this grade plastic.",5
B000LKYQJ0,"Yummy, smooth and rich dark chocolate. Not too sweet and tastes like very expensive dark chocolate. Perfect finish after a good meal or for a late night snack. Intense and silky.",5
B000LKYQJ0,"I was worried that 70% dark chocolate meant very bitter. I was totally wrong. What I found was smooth and sophisticated. A ""grown-up"" chocolate. The sweetness is very light but just right. Nibble it or just place it on your tongue and let it melt- either way is great.  I sometimes have just one small square and that satisfies my sweet craving. I refuse to spend my money on other brands now.",5
B000LKYQJ0,What's not to love about this delicious chocolate? I have no negative words! I have started eating it for breakfast and can assure you it's an excellent way to start the day!,5
B000LKYQJ0,"I've been buying these bars, singly, for years and years at the grocery store.  They were out of the black ones, for some reason, so I finally ordered an entire box.<br /><br />This is my favorite chocolate.  It's nice and dark and flavorful without being bitter or waxy.  It is the only bar of this richness that I have tried that melts well on the tongue.  Everything else this dark seems to just chip, which isn't any good.  Chocolove makes the winningest chocolate that I've tried, and their black bar is my old standby.<br /><br />The gold bar has good flavor, but doesn't melt well.  Some of the flavored bars are good.  The best is the peppermint (blue).  My other favorite is the ginger (green).  Can you tell I prefer dark to milk?<br /><br />If you're interested, it turns out you can send any of these chocolate bars through the mail with only a ""forever"" and a postcard stamp.  They were my valentines this year, wrapped up in colorful paper.  These are particularly appropriate for valentines because there is always a love poem on the inside of the paper. I tend to skip the poem and go straight for the treat.  Yum!",5
B000LKYQJ0,"Yes, what a deal!  Delicious chocolate that is good for you!  Also, this IS the best price you can find for it, even better than directly from Chocolove!!!  Maybe I shouldn't let them know that!",5
B000LKYQJ0,"I love many of the chocolove bars, they are all wonderful and full of flavor.  This one is a very simple suttle dark chocolate, not too strong but not lacking in flavor either. If you are a fan of dark chocolate I would give this one a try, its very smooth and coats the mouth in a wonderful soft dark chocolate.  Not sickly sweet at all, but just a touch of sweetness.  The cocoa flavor is perfect here.  Its not my most favorite dark chocolate but it is a nice treat to have to change things up a bit.",4
B000LKYQJ0,"This is my favorite dark chocolate...just don't order it in the summer!  It does not travel well, and has a tendency to melt or become discolored in the heat.  (Luckily, Nutricity is fabulous about refunds).",4
B000LKYQJ0,"The chocolate bars arrived on time packed with an icebag and in a nice box which makes it easily accessible to get one at a time.

B000LKYQJ0,"Sent these bars to both of my older kids as birthday presents with a note that this chocolate, eaten in moderation, could be consumed without guilt because dark chocolate is actually good for you!  Both kids loved the bars so now I guess I need to send some to myself!",4
B000LKYQJ0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend's mother. Not only was she quite pleased with the taste, but I was also surprised at the amount that was there. I would definitely recommend.",5

B000LKYQJ0,"This product is very high quality, the chocolate flavor is consistent, and it is smooth all the way through swallowing, without any bitter after taste whatsoever!",4
B000LKYQJ0,"These taste awesome. And I'm not a nutrition expert but they seem pretty healthy too, pretty low in sugar etc. I give this when I have women over (I'm a single bachelor) and they love it. It looks far more expensive than it is, and the poem on the inside of the label is a nice touch. I'll definitely be getting more when my current supply runs out (which will be soon at the rate I pick up women lately... haha).",5
B000LKYQJ0,I bought this because of the supposed health benefits.  Was concerned that the 70% cocoa would have a bitter taste.<br />Not so.  Very smooth and delicious. Great that something that tastes this good is healthy too!,5
B000LKYQJ0,"While the chocolates from Chocolove may be tasty, their treatment of folks they do business with is anything but. I shop and support small business because I believe them to be responsible to other small businesses they work with. When the management of Chocolove refused to pay for work done for them by friends of mine (also in Boulder), I can no longer buy their chocolate. There are many other small chocolate companies around and from now on my money will go to folks who do the right thing.",1
B000LKYQJ0,"If you are purchasing a box of Norman Love ""chocolates"" because they are pretty and artistic, you will probably get a box of creams.  They are NOT chocolates.  They have a thin candy coating that has a far-distant vague taste of chocolate, but it is overcome by the fruity cream in the middle. They may sell chocolate ""bars"" but I will never find out because their customer service is hateful and demeaning.  If you want a REAL artisan chocolate experience, order Christopher Elbow instead.",1
B000LKYQJ0,I just bought the toffee and almond bar.  It was the worst chocolate I've ever eaten in my life.  It tasted waxy.  The toffee was basically non-existent. I searched the bar for almonds and found a couple of tiny pieces.  I threw it away after only eating 2 small squares.  What a waste of money.  And my taste buds are very disappointed.  Maybe the dark chocolate is better but I definitely do not recommend this one.,1
B000N8QJUE,"All Annie Chung bowls are delicious, without a doubt. I believe everything to be in the perfect state of consistency, the sauce is neither too thick nor too thin, the noodles the perfect thickness. The flavor is actually not the typical Pad Thai flavor as you would get at a chain restaurant such as Pei Wei. It is again the perfect amount of flavor, just as the rest of the elements are well proportioned.<br />However, as ALL ready-made dishes are, this is full of sodium. I believe this dish to be on the healthier end of the ready-made noodle spectrum. You will get a heartier meal out of an Annie Chung bowl than out of any ramen package. It is far healthier than instant Yaki-soba which follows a bit of the same preparation tactic (freeze-dried veggies, etc.).<br />Basically, this is a very nice occasional treat. Tastes are discriminating, but I do really enjoy this bowl.",4
B000N8QJUE,"The good: This stuff is really well packaged and easy to make in the office. It comes in a biodegradable microwave-safe bowl, which is pretty awesome.<br /><br />The bad: It tastes nothing like pad thai.<br /><br />The ugly: It tastes awful, I don't know they managed to do this using natural ingredients - but it tastes very unnatural and leaves a lingering aftertaste. It will also help you continue on your way to hypertension and that first heart attack by giving you 60% of your sodium RDA in every bowl!",2
B000N8QJUE,"Annie Chun's Pad Thai Noodle Bowl is EXCELLENT! With its savory sauce and peanut topping, it's a way to enjoy the taste of Thailand in your own home. It's easily made (only 2 minutes in the microwave) However,it does need extras. Stir fry some tofu,veggies,or something like that to make it heartier. It could also use a squeeze of fresh lime like the original recipe. As usual, Annie Chun brings a taste of Asia to your kitchen!",4
B000N8QJUE,"Nasty. Absolutely NASTY! I can still smell it and I wish I couldn't. I only put a few drops of the sauce in because I hated the way it smelled, but I was still willing to give it a try because some great tasting things can smell bad.<br /><br />Nope... it was just as bad as it smelled. Extremely unnecessarily powerful flavor... kind of like drinking soy sauce and salt together. I guess someone might like it if their taste buds are numb.<br /><br />I will never touch another Annie Chun's product again because of this experience. I don't think their taste testers have my tastes because that was nasty to the EXTREME!<br /><br />If you buy this, then good luck.",1
B000N8QJUE,"I've tried 6 other Annie Chun's noodle flavors. Some I really liked and others just needed some meat added to taste yummy. But for this one, adding meat nor minimizing the amount of sauce didn't do anything to alter the awful sour taste. Please improve on the sauce.",1
B000N8QJUE,"flavor is okay but total product is disappointing, too many noodles, no veggies, high calories",2
B000N8QJUE,"Pad thai is the first thing I order at any thai restaurant. It varies depending on the restaurant, but I've always know it to have a tangy peanut sauce that's slightly sweet.<br /><br />However, these noodles just don't taste anything like any of the pad thai dishes I've had. It's also just not very good. The first thing I noticed upon opening the noodles packet was the unnatural smell it emitted. I tasted the noodles plain, and they were very noticeably sour with another unnatural note (detergent... perhaps). I know I did not get an expired package because every Annie Chun's bowl I've had was just like this. And they were all a year or two from expiration.<br /><br />I thought it might get better when I blended in the flavorings, but it didn't improve. Very sour, as if the noodles were seasoned primarily with vinegar. I gobbled them up because I was very hungry at the time, but they were not all that good. They're not very unpleasant, but they could be much better. Though, one nice thing about these is that they're very generous on the noodles, so they fill you up (they left me very satisfied even though I had been famished when I was making them).<br /><br />You also might want to consider that they have strong green onions. My boyfriend had to admit to me (trying not to sound harsh) that they made my breath smell of onions hours afterwards. We're close enough that we don't get embarrassed by things like that, but you that you might not want to have this in the office.",2
B000N8QJUE,"Even after reading the reviews I went ahead and made an order.<br /><br />The Good-- for something that is a packaged and pre-cooked off the shelf product, I would say it's pretty good. If you're used to eating Ramen Cup-o-Noodles, hands down Annie Chun wins.<br /><br />The Con-- Sure this doesn't taste just like the Pad Thai from a restaurant. I would say you have to be an idiot to expect any product/brand like this to offer a 1:1 experience. This product contains no meat or tofu.<br /><br />An extra note : I started out by buying these from Food Pyramid. When I got my first order from Amazon I noticed the bowl was engineered differently. Once I opened it, I noticed the sauce looked different also. The taste was different. It had more of a peanut flavor and I would say it was more of a mild plus, rather than a mild on the heat index. The rest of the ingredients were the same. I wanted to know why it was different. The packaging looked the same. At first I thought... Oh Amazon is just selling secondary product. I thought maybe the factor screwed up and sold it to Amazon on the cheap. Then I looked closer and saw something interesting. [...] - The package from Food Pyramid was labeled as Annie Chun, Inc. The one from Amazon was labeled JP Foods, Inc. Both had relatively close expiration dates, so I'm not sure what going with that. Did Annie Chun sell out to JP Foods? I don't know, but for a product that had the exact same package design, it was not the same item.",5
B000N8QJUE,"These convenience noodls are microwaveable, fast to make, can be done in an office or while camping and are all natural with no preservatives or MSG. I'm a big fan of them. I keep a store of these at work for when I just don't have time to go to lunch but I want something hot and soothing.<br /><br />I've said right up front, these do not taste like Pad Thai. Not exactly. But they taste GOOD. Your restaurant pad thai is going to have a more savory, tangy sauce, there are fresh toppings such as lime wedges, mung bean sprouts, cilantro, and Thai basil. Of course, you get none of that in this package. But for what these are, they taste good. There is a paste-like sauce in a packet, a dry packet of peanut chunks to dust on top, and the usual round wheat noodles. You reheat the noodles in water, drain it off then add the sauce, the peanuts and you are good to go.<br /><br />If you want to make it more tasty, you COULD add some lime juice, some cilantro, even some bean sprouts, but if you are eating noodles from a packet, chances are you don't have fresh ingredients to hand. So, enjoy these for what they are, savory, tangy noodles and do not imagine House of Siam in your mind's eye (tongue, whatever.)",4
B000N8QJUE,"Why?  Because the noodles come SOFT, sealed in plastic!  If you are tired of noodles that ""crunch"" or that have to be reconstituted out of the original cardboard, you are in for a treat!  Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.<br /><br />Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start.  You can always add more in later.<br /><br />Note: Since the bowl is made partially from cornstarch, it will biodegrade completely so toss it in the trash when you're done without feeling guilty.  (For this reason you should NOT attempt to reuse this bowl like you may have done with other brand instant noodle meals that came in plastic bowls.)",5
B000N8QJUE,I just ate one of these for lunch today and I thought it was awesome.  I went online to find more and I'm surprised it got such bad reviews.  I really liked it and I live in NYC where I eat pad thai and other foods enough to have some point of reference.  I thought it was pretty good.  The only thing I would do is add extra noodles if you're making it at home because I thought the sauce and spices were quite strong and could have been spread amongst more noodles.,5
B000N8QJUE,"I tried, I really tried to eat this.  I've eat her spicier food and was pleased.  I threw this out after a couple of bites.  It tasted like vineger and stale peanuts.",1
B000N8QJUE,"I saw an add on TV for these and then read some reviews on the net (some good some bad). I bought a case of these and wish I hadn't. The sauce tastes terrible (vinegary) and the noodles look, feel, and taste like plastic. Let's be honest here, this IS a crappy microwaveable lunch so I wasn't expecting anything great. I was still EXTREMELY disappointed. I have no idea how a product like this is out on the market. Didn't they do any panel taste tests?",1
B000N8QJUE,"I fed my garbage disposal this stuff after taking a couple bites of it myself. It promptly unhooked itself from the bottom of my sink and jumped out of a third-story window, finding a brutal end on the stones below.",1
B000N8QJUE,"I read all the reviews, but still wanted to give this a try. I love all of Annie Chun's soup bowls and really, really wanted to like this too. However, it was horrible! It smelled up the whole office and was so bad, I was embarrased. I bought a bunch of them, but they are going straight into the trash.",1
B000N8QJUE,"This is an instant noodle dish which you can whip up in 90 sec.  Compare to other instant foods, Annie Chun's foods are the best.  You think it has too much salt?  Add only half the sauce.  How much salt do you think there is in your cheese burger?  Not enough Thai flavor? Come on.  This is an instant food.  If you want real Thai flavor, either you have to make it yourself fresh or go to a Thai restaurant.  One poster said that she saute vegetables and shrimps with the sauce before she adds the noodle.  I'm going to totally copy her idea.  Yum!",5
B000N8QJUE,"I don't know what this is supposed to be but it tastes truly awful. If I was served this in a restaurant, I'd be running for the door. It looked unappealing when I opened up the pack and it totally lived up to it's looks. I ate it because I was hungry and I'd paid for it - but it wasn't a pleasant experience at all. Nothing like any Pad Thai I've ever eaten.  It tasted of what I imagine old cardboard to taste like. Ugh!",1
B000N8QJUE,"I absolutely love Pad Thai. It is one of my favorite dishes and I have eaten it in several Thai restaurants and although the variations are slightly different, it is always delicious. I have been trying to find Pad Thai in a box that I can heat up quite easily and eat it quickly, since I do not have time to go to the Thai restaurant in my city all the time! However, every single time I've tried Thai food in a box, it is nasty. This is no exception.<br /><br />One weird thing is that the noodles already felt damp when I opened the package. And then I opened the sauce packet....oh, I just about lost my appetite then. Pad Thai does NOT smell like that!!! It smelled similar to soy sauce, but worse. And then I tasted it...the taste was not any better and the aftertaste is even worse.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this. I'm never trying Pad Thai in a box again.",1
B000N8QJUE,"i'm gonna keep this short and sweet<br /><br />Tastes like play-doh, if you like to eat play-doh.. BUY THESE NOODLES, you won't be dissapointed.<br /><br />Update: decided to eat real play-doh after trying to eat these noodles. the play-doh tasted better.",1
B0012W1TQE,The coffee is very good compared to Maxwell drip and reasonably good compared to other Tassimo brands. This is my standard morning coffee. No complaints for the cost!,5
B0012W1TQE,"I have purchased these T discs many times and there is something wrong with this last order.  Does anyone else have the problem of the discs only making 3/4 of a cup?  It's not my machine because any other brand turns out fine.  I bought another package from a retail store and the same thing is happening!  For the money that these discs cost, this is unacceptable.  I bought a whole case!!!",3
B0012W1TQE,the coffee is good. but I've been trying to cancel the auto shipments but its impossible to find any way for customer service to help. therefore they continue sending it and I have to keep sending it back.,5
B0012W1TQE,This is still good coffee but they have DOUBLED the cost.  Half the price at BBB with a 20 percent coupon.  Also available half what Amazon is now charging @ Target & Walmart (at least it was available there a couple month ago),1
B0012W1TQE,"For anyone who simply wants a basic, American-style cup of coffee, this is perfectly fine. No, it's not as full-flavored or (arguably) as good as most of the higher priced Tassimo offerings, but it isn't intended to be. This is a simple, inexpensive cup for everyday use.<br /><br />That said, I knocked off a star due to Amazon's current pricing. The unit price for the ""Friday Sale"" is roughly the same as the individual retail price at many stores. That's not a deal -- and certainly doesn't represent the sort of discount one would expect to receive when buying a 5-pack.",4
B0012W1TQE,The coffee is excellent the price great. After my K cup took a dive I gave the T-disc a try Wow. It was better than any of the K-cup brands I had. The only unfortunate draw back is you can't seem to get the T-disc in stores. Good thing Amazon has them at a good price.,4
B0012W1TQE,I enjoy this coffee.  Biggest problem is that it overfills my mugs so that I have to watch it so as not to overflow. I don't understand why some brands overflow and some do not fill the cup.,4
B0012W1TQE,"I was surprised at the pleasant flavor of this coffee. Robust enough to satisfy, with a great smooth, full taste. One of my regular favorites for the Tassimo.",5
B0012W1TQE,This coffee is just the right strength for me.  It has no bitter aftertaste.  I love it! Great price with the save & subscribe feature and it comes right to you.,5
B0012W1TQE,"When I come down the stairs in the morning, and the kids are ""making coffee"" I smell the great aroma of the original Maxwell House coffee that I grew up with. When I get to the kitchen, I have a great cup of coffee, with no mess and no waste. The coffee disc's are expensive, but there is no ""day old"" coffee left sitting in the pot. This coffee is nothing fancy, not too strong, and taste good every time I fix a cup.",5
B0012W1TQE,These discs and the Tassimo coffee machine are incredibly easy to use and Amazon ships the discs in record time.,5
B0012W1TQE,"There is nothing really special about these t-discs coffee. It's not very strong, but it does radiate a fresh roasty flavor when brewed. This is definitely the most convenient way for me to brew coffee while in the office where I don't want to deal with the mess of coffee beans.",5
B0012W1TQE,This is a great tasting product and it is much cheaper than others. You can't beat it in any way. I drank many other coffees including Starbucks and found this to be quite satisfactory.,5
B0012W1TQE,"This Tassimo Maxwell coffee  from the Maxwell Cafe collection<br />is the choice at our house no matter who is choosing! Finally<br />a coffee that My husband, Kids & friends love! This price can't be Beat!",5
B0012W1TQE,Great cafe and a good product.. The most you can get for what you pay for love it . thx,5
B0012W1TQE,"This is great-tasting coffee.  So convenient in the T-Disk format.  When you want just one cup of coffee, just pop one of the T-Disks in your Tassimo and out comes a very good cup.  Maxwell House should be proud.",5
B0012W1TQE,"As the title says, this is a good basic cup of coffee.  We feel a little frustrated by the 6 ounce default pour - does anyone still drink coffee in these lilliputian quantities? Still, with a little time spent pressing the ""give me more"" button, we can get a nice full cup of medium bodied coffee. We generally alternate cups between this and Gevalia Vanilla Hazelnut on the weekends.",4
B0012W1TQE,The brand of coffee is a nice medium brew.  I don't like coffee that is too bold or strong and this fits the bill.,5
B0012W1TQE,"Do you remember what it smells like to add water to an ashtray full of cigarettes? That's how this coffee tastes. I added a caramel, some hazelnut flavoring, a packet of hot chocolate with miniature marshmellows, and Coffeemate vanilla chai creamer too it. It still tasted bitter, like wet cigarettes and metallic. I think the metallic flavor comes from the t-disc packaging. It doesn't make sense to buy a $100 coffee maker and drink trashy coffee. Especially when you can take that same amount of cash and buy some good coffee. I ignored the bad ratings of other reviewers because I believed the positive reviews. The only redeeming factors are that it is cheaper (less than $7 at Walmart), and that you can make a single cup of coffee. If it were allowed, I'd give it a -5 rating (or &lt;-> -,  for infinitly horrible).",1
B002AUF15C,"I had to put my son on a gluten free diet, but had a hard time finding an alternative carb source for him.  He refused any of the gluten-free oatmeals I cooked or rice breads.  He was use to his Quaker apple cinnamon instant oatmeal, and this is very similar in texture and taste.  I just add a couple spoonfuls of natural applesauce to sweeten it more, and he eats the whole bowl.  If you are looking for an alternative to the Quaker instant oatmeal packs, this will work out great for you.  My child is super picky, and this past the test with flying colors.",5
B002AUF15C,"I had been very disappointed to have to give up oatmeal cereal when I had to go to a gluten-free diet, so I jumped at the chance to try this out.  It comes in microwavable packets and is great tasting.  It makes me appreciate breakfast again and is so good that I am getting ready to order my next shipment so I don't run out.",5
B002AUF15C,"Have a delicious day! Wish I wrote that but it's off the box.So is this ""We make glutenfree delicious..it's what we do"" and boy did Glutenfreeda do it again.I've been hooked on Glutenfreeda products since they introduced their frozen cookies years ago. I was delighted to see them come out with instant oatmeal and I wasn't disappointed.I was doubly delighted to see the oatmeal offered on Amazon.com. Win,win! When you read the ingredient list you will see why- Off the Maple Raisin with Flax box :certified gluten free oats, raisins, organic maple sugar,brown sugar , flax meal and salt.That's it and yes you read the ingredient list correctly.Real ingredients for my real family.I was very happy to see a very low sodium content and the addition of flax.<br /><br />I always have a packet with me for a quick snack or those ""eat at the desk"" lunches. My husband who is not on the gluten free diet loves this oatmeal.He says the oats taste fresher. And for my Celiac college student this product has made his life so much easier.He can have a healthy breakfast in his dorm room or at the food court with no worry of cross-contamination.Like me he always has a packet in his backpack for snacks or a quick lunch.<br /><br />Thank you Glutenfreeda!",5
B002AUF15C,"I have been gluten free for 24 years, and have missed hot oatmeal on cold winter mornings ever since. I recently discovered<br />Glutenfreeda's instant hot oatmeal, and tried the apple cinnamon brand. I am so thankful for how wonderful it was to have<br />a delicious bowl of oatmeal again! It was really tasty, and a true five star product for me. Thank you, Glutenfreeda.",5
B002AUF15C,"This is my celiac daughters favorite.  So glad to find something similar to Quaker's instant oatmeal.  I like this one and the maple, my daughter didn't care for the maple.",5
B002AUF15C,I love this gluten free oatmeal.  It's the only instant gluten free oatmeal in the market and it's so quick and easy to prepare.  Thank you to Glutenfreeda and to Amazon for making it available!,5
B002AUF15C,"I have been gluten-free for over 5 years and dairy and soy-free for 8 months.  My daughter has been corn-free for quite some time and gluten and  dairy-free for the past 9 months.  We were ecstatic when we learned about Glutenfreeda's Oatmeal being safe for both of us.  It had been soooo long since I could make a packet of flavored oatmeal in a jiffy.  And with my daughter's corn-allergy, it has been even longer for her.  We are now in heaven and love all three flavors.  We eat it for breakfast, snacks, whatever.  It isn't as sweet as we both like it, but a spoon of demerara organic sugar and we're both ready to enjoy.<br /><br />Anyone who can buy any brand or kind of instant oatmeal off the shelf just can not fathom our excitement, but it is truly a wonderful thing to be able to enjoy instant oatmeal again!!",5
B002AUF15C,"My kids and I really missed the convenience of instant oatmeal packets when we went gluten-free over two years ago. The sweetness of Glutenfreeda oatmeal is just right for me. (Quaker was too sweet.) The flavor and texture is good, making this a great choice for busy mornings. Two thumbs up!",5
B002AUF15C,"I have this cereal every weekday morning.  Don't use microwave, just pour packet in a bowl or cup, add boiling water, let sit for a minute, add chopped walnuts or whatever, and eat!  No sweetener needed.  Love it!<br /><br />Joanne",5
B002AUF15C,Great gluten free oatmeal! Easy to use at home or work. I use mine with my Starbucks oatmeal thermos. Use hot tap to mix it when I get to work and eat it 2 hours later-GREAT!!,5
B002AUF15C,I have tried all of the flavors but love the apple cinnamon the best! It's so yummy and super convenient to bring to work every morning. :),5
B002AUF15C,I am so thankful for this oatmeal having severe gluten and corn allergies!  It tastes great and I don't have to worry about cross contamination with my allergies.  Highly recommend!,5
B002AUF15C,"This oatmeal is easy to prepare and tastes very good. I normally add about 27g protein powder to it also.  Microwave for 90 seconds, let stand for 2 minutes, and then microwave again for 30 seconds.  Just finished a case of this flavor, and just ordered a case of the Apple Cinamon and a case of the Maple Raisin.  Tastes much better than any other instant oatmeal I've ever found.  Dave",5
B002AUF15C,It's quick and easy to make.<br />It's gluten-free<br />I. would say that the taste is equal to what I remember of regular instant oatmeals.,4
B002AUF15C,"In my area there are not to many options for instant oatmeal that is gluten free. This one is one option. It is ok, however, one needs to add some more cinnamon to it.",3
B002AUF15C,My whole family likes this oatmeal. Buying it by the case is the right way to go and that way you you don't run out very quickly.,5
B002AUF15C,"Just found this gluten free oatmeal.  This is for sure the best find of the year.  My kid loves it, but I think its a little too sticky.  That it has fLax in it and my kid will still eat it is an added bonus.",4
B002AUF15C,"I was VERY excited to find this oatmeal on Amazon and at a considerably lower price than what I paid at my local store.  This is a great quick and easy breakfast.  As with any instant oatmeal, items might be added to it to fit each person's preferences, but I think it's good just as it is. :)",5
B002AUF15C,"I am so grateful to be able to eat oatmeal again!  I have celiac disease and have been gluten-free for about 3 years.  I have always loved breakfast cereal and oatmeal, but I have found that most gluten-free cereals are expensive and tasteless.  So disappointing.  I have tried other oats and have always had reactions.  I figured I could give this a try and see if I tolerated it.  I was pleasantly surprised not just that I could eat them without having symptoms but that the oats themselves are great!  Dig in!",5
B000GZUAFE,"I first stumbled upon this mix a good ten years ago when I was a more strict vegetarian. I have since become a little more lenient in my diet but this is an old favorite. I do the beginning as suggested, boil 2.5c water and then add the chili mix (1 box) but from there, I do my own thing. They suggest using 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of beans but I find that I get a much more mellow but still hearty, flavorful chili and it either feeds several more or leaves a good bit leftover by adding the following: 1 can of Great Northern beans, 1 can of black beans, 1 can of diced tomatoes, and a bit of powdered garlic (I picked the different beans for flavor/color/texture variation and the garlic is based on your personal tastes). If it's too thick for you, add up to 1 can of stewed tomatoes so that it thins it without diluting the flavor.<br /><br />Anyways, it tastes great fresh out of the pot with cheese and sour cream or on top of a baked potato. Unless I am serving others, my son and I always have leftovers but they freeze well if we don't want to eat them in the next couple of days. The real taste test was serving this to both my grandfather and my dad...they are big meat eaters who would have refused to eat it if I had told them up front it was vegetarian. Both liked it enough to ask for seconds and I've since made it for them and others on multiple occasions. :)",5
B000GZUAFE,This is a great vegetarian chili. It tastes homemade like the kind you grew up eating that your mother made. I highly recommend this for vegans and vegetarians. Being a Texas girl growing up on Mexican food I add chopped jalepenos to mine.,5
B000GZUAFE,"This is the best vegetarian chili I have tried. The box says to add 1 can of tomatoes and 1 can of bean. I like alot of tomaotoes in my chili so I always add 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes. Black beans are awesome in this but you can use any kind you like. I like to spice mine up a bit with cayenne pepper too. My boyfriend who is a meat and potatoe guy loves it, and usually he will never eat my vegetarian food.",5
B000GZUAFE,"I picked this up on a whim after trying the Fantastic Foods tacos. And with a minimal amount of doctoring (I added some cumin, chili powder, sugar, and corn to mine)  it honestly tasted like the chili I grew up eating. I am impressed. It seems like the brand picked a suitable name.",5
B000GZUAFE,"yummy! i also use it for spaghetti, if u dont add beans and add noodles",5
B000GZUAFE,"I love this chili!. For me it's flavorful enough to handle an extra can of beans (or corn) in addition to the one can each of beans and tomatoes suggested on the box.<br /><br />I started out making it just for myself while the other four people in my family would eat our traditional beef-and-bean chili, which they swore they would never give up. At some point, I started secretly using the vegetarian chili as a base for chili con carne. In addition to the box recommendations, I add 1 lb cooked ground turkey, a can of Bush's chili beans, and an additional can (or even two) of plain (black, kidney, or pinto) beans. My whole family enjoys a hearty chili meal (with leftovers!), and I am happy knowing they are eating less saturated fat, and overall less meat than they otherwise would. They know what I'm up to now, and are fussing because I'm OUT of Fantastic Foods Vegetarian Chili. Who would have ever thought it?",5
B000GZUAFE,"Fantastic Foods' Vegetarian Chili (they call it chilE in New Mexico,thank you very much!) is delicious&filling. It's simple to prepare, and the cook is free to embellish. For a vegetarian chile,it's more substantial than the usual triad of beans/tomatoes/corn. The recipe on the side of the box (for Southwest Nachos) is helpful for building on the basic recipe (such as adding lime/lemon juice,sour cream,shredded cheese,cilantro) The cheese&sour cream are also helpful in cutting the slight saltiness.<br /><br />This Vegetarian Chili is one of the best out there. It makes plenty to last. Yes,there are leftovers-- or you could make nachos with it for a party. It's not as spicy as it claims to be,so feel free to add spices of your own. Fantastic Foods' Vegetarian Chili is a delicious culinary odyssey to the Southwest!",4
B000GZUAFE,"I have used Fantastic Foods products in the past, notably the sloppy joe mix, but this chili mix is so salty I am up all night going into the kitchen for water.  Also, and I noticed this with the sloppy joe mix too, the clear bag inside of the box gives way so that some of the mix spills out and I assume this would impact the freshness.  I finally ended up dumping all the bags out into one airtight container and when i use it I just scoop out what I think I need with a measuring cup.  I find I can use it in soup to add texture and being in soup the salty-ness is diluted.  I won't buy it again.",3
B000GZUAFE,"I did a terrible thing when I ordered this Fantastic Vegetarian Chile from Amazon.com.<br />We had ice and snow thick and I decided to try this chile. This was before I ordered my beans and tomatoes. I took the packet and added water and about burned my toungue off. Not due to the heat--but due to the flavor.<br /><br />I was ready to cancel my regular delivery's and took the time to order the beans and tomatoes and sliced tomatoes.<br /><br />OH MY gosh---I only used about half of the chile mix, added 2 cans of diced tomatoes, one can of sliced potatoes and some beef flavoring along with the water.  WOW--it was so good.<br /><br />I guess I will get twice as much use from this chile as I can only use half of it.<br /><br />I am beginning to realize--we can use our imaginations and really prepare food the way we like it. I ate some last night and had some for lunch today.  Great stuff--",5
B000GZUAFE,"This chili is really great and super easy to make! I learned of it in college, and can rarely find it in stores. Whenever I come across it I grab a few boxes, so happy to have found it online! Delicious flavor that can be dressed up easily with cheese, sour cream and hot sauce. And if you're a non-vegetarian like me, don't worry, you won't miss the meat.",5
B000GZUAFE,"I've been eating this chili for the past 16 years... it's nice to buy 12 at a time w/ fast delivery! :)<br /><br />Makes great chili I add additional spices... fennel adds a nice sausage taste. Frito Pies, Nachos, Chili Cheese pups... mmm mmm mm!!!",5
B000GZUAFE,Fantastic makes the best vegetarian chili it's quick and ez and not even my Carnivours miss the meat. Spice it up with green chiles and folks. Will be singing your praises,5
B000GZUAFE,"I have been trying to cut back on calories and this chili is low fat and very filling. I add some cumen powder, chili powder, and red pepper flakes to the boiling water before adding the chili mix along with 28 oz canned chopped tomatoes and a 15 oz can black beans and a can of tomato paste.  Serve with shredded cheese and non-fat sour cream. I just love this product.",5
B000GZUAFE,I used to buy this at the local grocery stores.  It is no longer available which is a shame because it is such a terrific product.  'Gad I could purchase it through Amazon.,5
B000GZUAFE,"This vegetarian chili mix is simple to make! I prepared the chili in under 15 mins. (using the stovetop method) and spooned it over some leftover rotini noodles, sprinkled on some cheddar cheese and microwaved about 20 seconds to melt. The chili is very flavorful (although not spicy enough for me). I plan to keep buying this mix and preparing it different ways, including the suggestions provided by the previous reviewers. I would love to see a hot and spicy version of this mix in my grocery store!",4
B000GZUAFE,"My (military) unit is hosting a chili cookoff as they often do, and I wanted to insert my vegetarian version, mostly so I will have something to eat too, but also because I've loved this brand for years and I know it can fool a meateater in a minute.  I went bopping over to my local Publix (the only place I've been able to find it) where they have not only completely redesigned the aisle structure, but dumped the brand altogether.  What a shame.<br /><br />Something told me to just check Amazon.com.  Not only is it available, but in CASES, and at much less than I paid per box at the grocer's!  And they will have it here by tomorrow.  Just doesn't get any better.<br /><br />So glad living in the middle of nowhere doesn't mean I have to go without my fav vegetarian and vegan foods.  Thanks Amazon!",5

If you are trying to avoid that ingredient and looking to purchase this food based on its false health food marketing, you can verify this bad news for yourself by checking out the product in the natural food section of your store.

B000W5U5H6,"My dogs liked the taste of this food just fine, although they didn't go crazy for it.  (I purchased it for a dog who was very thin and needed to gain weight.)<br /><br />The ingredient list of this food sounds great-- no corn or other indigestible grains, and lots of great healthy vegetables, fruits, and carbs in addition to high quality meats and probiotics.  There are NO yucky ""meat by-products""-- just meats and meat meals you can feel good about.  Unfortunately this food has a higher than normal fat and protein content. Very high protein (minimum 32% in this food) may not be a good choice for every dog (this is especially a concern for older dogs).  The fat percentage (minimum 18%) may great for working dogs and active dogs, but the average American couch potato dog could pack on pounds with that much fat unless you increase exercise and/or reduce your portion size (and that may lead to a dog who doesn't feel full/stays hungry).<br /><br />If your dog is already overweight you would probably want a food with one-third the fat of this product.  If you decide to use this food I think it would be a good idea to monitor your dog's weight carefully to avoid having weight gain sneak up on you and your best pal.  I am skeptical of dog foods which claim to be perfect for all life stages, too-- puppies and 15 year old dogs can survive on the same foods, but that doesn't mean the same foods are ideal for each dog.<br /><br />You might want to compare this with similar high-quality holistic foods such as Blue Buffalo Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs. or Wellness Super5Mix Chicken Dry Dog Food (30-lb bag) (there are several great Wellness varieties) or Nutro Natural Choice Ultra Adult Dog Food- net wt. 35 lbs. (there are several varieties of Nutro Ultra, too).  These foods have the same high quality human grade ingredients, but appear to have a little bit lower protein and fat profiles.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's a list of the major ingredients/nutritional profile-- check it out, talk it over with your vet, and make up your own mind about whether or not this is a good choice for your best pal.<br /><br />Bison, venison, lamb meal, chicken meal, egg product, sweat potatoes, peas, potatoes, canola oil, roasted bison, roasted venison, natural flavor, tomato pomace, ocean fish meal, choline chloride, dried chicory root, tomatoes, blueberries, raspberries, yucca schidigera extract, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces cerevesiae fermentation solubles, dried Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, and the expected added vitamins.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Wondering if your dog is overweight?  An easy way to tell is to look down at your dog while it is standing.  Viewed from overhead, you should see a definite ""waist"" narrowing in front of the back legs.  Another easy test is to feel the dog's ribs.  You should be able to easily feel slight dips between the ribs-- if you can't they are covered with a layer of fat (of course, prominent ribs mean your dog is too thin).",4
B000W5U5H6,"First of all I would like to say that my puppy LOVES this food! I have a 4 month old Lhasa Apso and he licks his bowl well after he has finished eating. When I first got him the breeder had him on Purina Puppy Chow. The first thing I wanted to do was to switch him to a high quality, no grain diet and after alot of research and reviews,Taste of The Wild always came on top(dollar wise). After the switch I immediately noticed a difference in my puppy.His coat is starting to shine and is sooooo soft to the touch. He has so much energy now and he has less eye discharge and less ear odor(due to being allergic to the Puppychow). My only problem I have with this product is when I went to my local pet store to buy him a 15lb bag. I immediately saw on the bag ""Now made with Purified Water and More Bison"" and I thought to myself; ""wow they made it better"", but after reading the ingredients boy was I wrong. They might have added more bison but they totally eliminated venison from the list. Venison was the second ingredient but now its lamb meal. What once this dog food had four meat products as its main ingredients(Bison, venison, lamb meal, chicken meal) now has three(Bison, lamb meal, chicken meal). More bison or not the exclusion of venison takes away some of the ""wildness"" of the formula in my opinion. Sure it still has roasted venison down the list but it just that, DOWN the list. In my opinion they've downgraded the formula but are still charging the same price and I am a little concerned by that. I emailed the company for more info on the ""New Formula"" before I buy the bag and will post an update soon.<br /><br />UPDATE!<br />Just received an email regrading the formula change by the company;<br /><br />Dear Eric,<br /><br />""Thank you for your inquiry. I'm glad that your puppy has been doing so well on the Taste of the Wild High Prairie. The formula had to be changed because an adequate supply of quality venison was not available. The change is relatively minor with the venison being replaced with bison, already a part of the recipe. I would not expect you to notice a difference with your puppy. However, if you still have some of the food in the previous bag, I would mix the food from both bags for a few days to avoid any potential issues. If you do not have any food from the previous bag, you could add some plain nonfat yogurt to your puppy's diet for a few days to help prevent any issues. I usually recommend 1 tablespoon per 25 pounds body weight"".<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />--<br />Melissa Brookshire, DVM<br /><br />Just to let you guys know that the formula change might cause some minor stomach issues so adjust accordantly.",3
B000W5U5H6,"I have to say that without a doubt this is the very best food I have ever fed my dogs, both were adopted and didn't like any dog food that we gave them. The food would sit all day, and then we would throw it out give them a fresh set and it would sit until (I'm guessing) they were both so hungry they didn't have a choice but to eat it, and this always made me feel sooo bad. I went to the ""natural dog food store"" the owner of the store was amazing and gave me a few free samples of the taste of the wild line of dog food. I was skeptical but went home and fed it to Jasmine and Peanut, my MinPin and Pekinese mix, much to my surprise they licked the bowl clean and have been ever since, they enjoy dinner time now, they have more energy, their coats are so much softer, and they are going to the bathroom on a much more regular basis. I have nothing bad to say about this food, and if you love your babies as much as I love mine, TRY IT! you won't be disappointed.<br />Samantha",5
B000W5U5H6,"I have new 72lb mixed 1.5 year old pup, who was losing hair at age 1. I read on the internet that he may be allergic to his food and may need more protein in his diet. So I started him on this food, and one 3mg melatonin, and 1 salmon fish oil tablet and he is absolutely beautiful now. His hair is shinny and he is real healthy. Now my old 15 year old dog Grizzly is a 100 lb Rottweiler & Golden Retriever mix, he is the best dog I ever had. The vet said he has lived more then twice the normal age for his breeds. Well Grizzly is also on this food and his hair is shinny, I also give him 2 to 3 Dasuquin tablets a day, and he can still get up 2 steps in to our house.<br /><br />I highly recommend this food.",5
B000W5U5H6,"Our dog was put on a ""special diet"" years ago (he is 9), as a result of constant diarrhea and skin problems. The vet<br />put him on Iam's, which helped with the symptoms, but he always acted as if he was starved. The Taste of the Wild changed<br />all that. He is healthy, active, and satisfied with this food. No diarrhea ever, great consistent bowel movements, good coat<br />and no bad breath.",5
B000W5U5H6,"I know nobody wants to read a wall of text on how good or bad this dog food is, so here is a very brief summary:<br /><br />This review is specifically for the High Prairie formula only.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Bison and Venison as the main 2 ingredients in the dog food! Not that Bison and Venison meat is any better, but it might help out dogs that has allergies to common meats such as Chicken, Beef and/or fish. Best part of it is that the price of the dog food costs the same as other flavors! A lot of dog foods meant for dogs with allergies usually tend to cost a lot more.<br />2. Price per pound is very economical. Price is actually much cheaper than lower quality foods such as Eukanuba, Purina, etc. It isn't cheaper than Pedigree, but at the same time it isn't filled with garbage like Pedigree is.<br />3. Dog likes the taste. A lot of my friends feed this to their dogs. I fed it to one of my dogs before. He likes it as much as he does for the fish flavor. My other dog doesn't but he doesn't like any kibble anyways, so it isn't this food's fault.<br />4. Food quality is good. No by-products or corn or any other garbage (like unknown sources of bone and meat meals, etc).<br />5. No more ethoxyquin in any taste of the wild products!<br />6. Solid poop with no disgusting smells!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Dogs seem to poop more on this food than other brands such as Orijen or Wellness. Not a lot more though so this isn't really a biggie.<br />2. Made by diamond Pet foods. Not really a biggie either, but diamond pet foods had been plagued with pet recalls problems in the past. Taste of the Wild hasn't had any recalls that I know of, but you're still running a risk, just a really small one.<br /><br />Compared to other brands, this is probably 4 out of 5, but it would be unfair because this brand is much cheaper. Orijen costs almost 2x of what taste of the wild cost.",5
B000W5U5H6,"I have purchased 3 bags of Taste of the Wild Bison and Venison. I had 2 Standard Poodle when I purchased the first bag. My 5 yr old SP is notoriously picky and has a very sensitive stomach. She LOVED this food. We went through the first bag and both were doing great. (Gaining weight which is very hard for her to do). So I ordered a second bag, exactly the same. They ate almost all of it over several weeks and all was fine. With the last several cups in the food container the 1 year old SP became violently ill like she has never been before. The older one then became sick. I figured they had gotten into some thing outside and reordered. The 3rd bag came several days later, both had recovered completely by this time. We also got a Bichon Frise puppy about a week before this. The older dogs had Taste of the Wild late in the afternoon and the puppy grabbed some they had spilled on the floor. All 3 dogs then became ill, throwing up all night. Immediately the next morning I removed all Taste of the Wild from the house and put them all on puppy food. Everything cleared up. I have called customer service and was told their vet would be calling me. That was several days ago. I have now emailed requesting a refund.",1
B000W5U5H6,"I have a 65lb 3 year old Boxer and an 80 lb 8 month old Cane Corso. They both love this food. Luckily, I live next to a pet food distributor, and it is cheaper there. ($[...] for the 30lb bag) This has been the only food my boxer has been able to keep weight on. We've tried Evo (Which worked but it was too expensive), Innova, Candidae, and solid gold no grain formula. She always looked sickly thin. Most her ribs showed and  some of her spine. We took her to the vet and they found nothing wrong with her. She is just an extremely active dog. We tried switching around foods to see if we could get her to gain weight. After switching to this formula, she looks like a NORMAL dog! You can not see her ribs as easily anymore and can pet her without feeling her spine. I guess she was just too active for the other foods.<br />My Cane does very good on it too. He is the perfect the weight! Although I think it has too much protein for him to be on it for very long.<br />I would recommend this food for people who have VERY active dogs like mine. The ingredients are good too, it is grain free. (My boxer is also allergic to grains) It is worth the extra money to spend on a good quality dog food like this one!",5
B000W5U5H6,"My dog dog loves this food. She learned how to open up a locked container where I store the bag just to eat more of it.<br /><br />It goes bad sooner than they mark on the bag (kinda like potato chips without a clip on the bag). The Purina Dog Chow I bought over a year ago is still fresh, but I don't want her eating meat coming from sick cows. By ""Fresh"" I mean my dog doesn't snub it in the bowl and it doesn't have an ""off"" smell to it.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy more than a 4-6 month supply at a time, and make sure you keep it in a sealed container (I bought 80lbs of this for a 18lbs dog- BAD MOVE).<br /><br />I've seen a few dogs have their eyes clear up after starting this- no more tear stains.<br /><br />Best dog food for the money, and used by show dog breeders.",4
B000W5U5H6,"I have an English bulldog, Kingston, who is 5 months old and LOVES this stuff.  He was raised on Puppy Chow and I tried many cheaper brands.  I was taking him out 5-6 times a day and I could tell he was miserable.  His coat was dull and he shedded and scratched constantly. So I decided I should switch to a better quality product.  I did a lot of research and can assure you that TOTW is the best product out there in terms of quality AND price.  Kingston's coat is velvety soft (I cheat a little by mixing in a few pumps of salmon oil) and he's pretty lean- not fat- a active for a bully!  About feeding though- he doesn't lick the bowl clean like everyone else.  The way I see it he is a ""low energy"" dog.  This stuff is high protein, high quality and designed for much more active breeds.  I'm just glad he'll actually eat it (wouldn't touch Nature's Balance LID) and not throw it up (Merrick's Before Grain).  So if your dog is like mine (couch potato) my advice would be to feed them the lower end amount.  Too much of this stuff and your pup may ""outgrow"" his body and this could lead to health issues.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CLWS8"">Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, High Prairie Canine Formula with Roasted Bison and Venison, 5 Pound Bag</a><br />Go with the small bag and see what your pup thinks",5
B000W5U5H6,"After adopting my German Shepard/Husky mix I noticed he had an allergy to the dog food his Vet. and Humane society recommended.Can dogs be allergic to grain? So I immediately did research. Ordered a sample pack and he LOVED IT! So I ordered a bag in 2009, and now I ONLY buy this product for his food. His coat is glossy, his teeth clean, and his body is so lean. He was under weight when we adopted him and now he's at a good weight, active and loving his food. I also noticed the change in the recipe, but I didn't tell him. A GREAT PRODUCT for those who want to feed their dogs REAL food. Dogs don't need all that extra grain, Brewers Rice, Corn Gluten Meal, Oat Meal, Whole Grain Wheat...THERE'S your FAT---THERE'S the ingredients your dogs DON'T NEED. I totally recommend this product.",5
B000W5U5H6,I have a 9 year old pug and he was scratching and getting ear infections on a regular basis. I decided to try BlueBuffalo and it gave him the worst gas imaginable. I then switched to TOTW and the gas immediately stopped. The scratching stopped as well and his ear infection is getting better but not completely gone. I'm on my second order and I will continue with this brand. It ships within 48 hours and the bonus is that I pay with my Discover Card CashBack Bonus through Amazon. Love that.,4
B000W5U5H6,...as advertised....good food and a good buy...I have ordered form this site more than once and never disappointed...I recommend purchasing from this site to all dog lovers.  This brand of dog food is one of the best manufactured---particulary with dogs that have allergies.,5
B000W5U5H6,"Previously subject animal was on a diet of Diamond Lamb & Rice. Upon switching to Taste of the Wild Bison, also a Diamond product, subject had increased energy and weight gain. Taste of the Wild makes some great Grain Free dog foods. It's unfortunate that major pet store chains usually do not carry it. Protein content varies greatly amongst Taste of the Wild products; the Bison formula containing the most.",5
B000W5U5H6,"This is the best food I've found for my dog, who I feed grain free. It is high in protein and lower in calories than other foods of the same type. And more reasonable in price too. My dog loves it too! I am glad Amazon carries it.",5

B000W5U5H6,"I would have understood, had the bag ripped in transit.  However, the shipping box was intact.  Inside, the bag of dog food had a hole that had been taped over.  Clearly, I had been sent damaged goods. I sent it back and will now buy the food locally.",1
B000W5U5H6,"Loki eats it with great relish,  he cleans the bowl each time he is fed, twice daily.  The reason we tried this was based on the vet's suggestion we vary the primary source of protein in his diet.  This seems to meet the bill handily.  We are anxious to try some of the other recipes.",4
B0042YU5EQ,The package arrived on time and looked good from the outside. The chocolate squares were discolored and broken. I will not purchase this product from this vendor again.,1
B0042YU5EQ,"I do really like these candies. They have something for everyone. I don't like dark chocolate but my fiance does so this suits us both since it offers two milk chocolate and two dark chocolate varieties. I also love that these chocolates come individually wrapped. I will admit the caramel are my favorite and I went through those really quickly. My only two critiques are the quality of the chocolate. Claiming this is ""Premium"" chocolate is a bit much. The chocolate quality is equal to Hershey's. The two milk chocolates offered are caramel filled and just milk chocolate, not filled with chocolate ganache or what the picture shows which is peanut butter filled. It literally is just a chunk of milk chocolate, which is mediocre.",3
B0042YU5EQ,"These turned out to be very good for less expensive chocolate.  They are very creamy and thin with a nice filling in most of them.  I will not waste my tastebuds or the calories on inferior chocolate and these are OK by me.  Would order again...and probably will when these are gone.  Only complaint, I wish there was a little more variety in the pack.",5
B0042YU5EQ,"Nice selection of flavors that were a big hit when these went into the office candy bowl. I only managed to grab one for myself, the raspberry-filled (which was delicious), but that's probably for the best since I'm working on losing weight.",5
B0042YU5EQ,"We needed a bunch of these chocolate squares for a party, and ordering two big bags of these things via Amazon turned out to be the easiest way to go. It might seem weird ordering a bag of chocolates online, but it worked out well and I'd do it again.",4
B0042YU5EQ,"I was very tempted to keep these for myself instead as the gift I was going to give them as. However, I know that my father would love these more than I. Arrived earlier than I thought, was very pleased.",5

B0042YU5EQ,I ordered this for my sister for Christmas.  She loved it - hated me for sending it (ha ha) - but loved the chocolate.,5
B0042YU5EQ,The first bag was dated 2012 but the product inside was dated 2007 and was discolored and stale. The second bag was dated 2012 and the product inside was dated 2011 and was very good. I feel the first bag should be replaced. Thanks  We received a refund for the old product. Thanks,2
B0042YU5EQ,"The individual chocholate squares are bigger than I thought, about an inch in length on each side. These chololates are good, I would purchase them again.",4
B0042YU5EQ,"First off this product in itself is a great deal, the chocolate comes out to about $9.4 per pound at a price of around $15.50.  The chocolate in itself is absolutely fantastic but there is one flaw to this product.  I had to dock off one star because personally I like chocolate by itself and although this product does come with milk chocolate pieces I found that the majority of the pieces were the mint and caramel chocolate pieces.  I didn't get a chance to specifically count the number of milk chocolate pieces but based on an estimate I would rank as most chocolate types to least as mint > caramel > raspberry > milk chocolate.  I can't say for sure that if you order one that you will get the same ratio of chocolates but that is just how mine turned out to be.  Like I said earlier the chocolate is fantastic and I highly recommend this product if you're just craving some chocolate! Cheers!",4
B0042YU5EQ,It came to me in good shape and tasted even better! I love the brand and I am happy to find that all the four tastes are very good.,5

It includes our favorites-caramel, mint, raspberry, and peanut butter. 50 pieces of individually wrapped candy is a generous amount.<br /><br />I added these to my holiday gift treat bags-recipients were very pleased & delighted.

B0001BH5YM,"What can one say, this is the premiere moutarde. We've been using it since we brought one back from France in the 70's. It also is magnificent for any recipe that calls for mustard (forgive my French) like Caesar's Salad. And, you get to keep the pot. I personally like to put in fond memories I had of French politicians. Needless to say, the pot is still empty, but the next election may bring us something to put in there!",5
B0001BH5YM,"I first had this mustard in Paris and loved it. It is great to be able to purchase it now in the states. This is a good size crock, well worth the price, I have carried many home from Paris! I can't find any other mustard in the states that has the same quality of taste.<br />Pommery mustard makes a wonderful marinade for chicken with some olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, rosemary, a few red pepper flakes, fry it in olive oil... its amazing. Leftovers (if any) freeze good too.<br /> Also makes a vegetable dip that everyone wants the recipe for - mayo, sour cream, minced onion, minced garlic, pommery mustard: its so good you don't need the veggies!<br />I am not a fan of plain mustard so don't know if you can use this product alone as a condiment.<br />Bon appetit",5
B0001BH5YM,"I originally bought this because of the cool crock it came in. But the whole seed, complex, delectableness inside made me an official mustard snob. :-) . This mustard is so good, I serve it by itself on crackers for hors d'oeuvres. Honestly, you can eat this stuff straight. It makes a nice gift too.",5
B0001BH5YM,"When you say ""mustard"" this is the stuff you should mean-- fragrant, acidic, sublime.  Unfortunately, the price reflects not only the wretched value of the dollar against the Euro, but a 100% tax imposed by the US government!  Imposed during the Clinton years, the 100% tariff on French Mustard still remains on the books-- and it's more than high time it came off! Write your Senators and Reps-- I just picked up two jars in Paris at an overpriced shop there-- at under 10 Euros each!<br />If you can't wait, though, for the wheels of government to grind this mustard fine, exceedingly fine, then pony up the extra dosh and get some. Me, I'll be bringing a bigger suitcase next time, and considerably more than two jars home with me!",5
B0001BH5YM,"Used to be able to buy this mustard in almost any cheese shop at a price thought high at the time ($9.00) - but no more...it just seemed to have disappeared.  My family used it exclusively  and we all had uses for the crock, too. So I began a search for my mustard and finally found it on Amazon.  It made my day!<br /><br /> I love the mustard itself - so different from the usual; this is only seeds, water, spices, etc.  For the last few years have been buying it on Amazon. Use it on everything - sandwiches, lamb chops, deviled eggs and still love the crock it comes in. If you Google ""Pommery Mustard"" you can get recipes and rave reviews from restaurants who have incorporated into their menus.<br /><br />It's a bit pricey because of shipping, but worth every penny and it lasts a very long time.  Have told friends about it, and once people use it they never want to go back to the yellow/brown/ supermarket type.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon, you came through again!",5
B0001BH5YM,"I am so excited!  I used to find this mustard in my grocery store, but no more.  I use this to make a mustard crust for beef tenderloin, but now that I know my supply isn't limited, this mustard will be the foundation of all kinds of new dishes.  It truly is fit for kings!",5

B0001BH5YM,This is a stone-ground mustard that is just wonderful on a sandwich or in recipes that call for mustard where it is not completely blended into the other ingredients but is still visible on its own.  The flavor is wonderful; not too strong or too hot.  This isn't a Dijon-style mustard and there is no hint of horseradish.  Try it and you'll be hooked.,5
B0001BH5YM,"This is my favorite mustard. It is the perfect blend of mustardy tang and other spices.

The exquisite flavor not only adds to any mouthful of food but also wakes up the flavors of everything else you're eating.  Best mustard to go with prime beef.  Best mustard for sandwiches with lean meats, lettuce and fresh sprouts.  Best mustard with crackers and gourmet cheese (or, hey, just with crackers!).  A little goes a long way, and you feel coddled whenever you have some.<br /><br />We used to live near a gourmet food store where we could buy this whenever we ran out.  We got spoiled, and now it's VERY hard to find.  So great to see it on Amazon -- wow!!!!",5
B0001BH5YM,"I have used this mustard for as long as I can remember, and no longer am able to obtain locally.  So, I purchase on-line.  Great with sausages; pates; gourmet burgers; cheeses; wet rub for fish; and, just about anything on which you would put mustard, even pretzels.",5
B0001BH5YM,I ordered this mustard to send to my mother in California. She received it in very few days and I was surprised how fast The Frenchy Bee sent the Pommery Gourmet mustard.

B0001BH5YM,"Absolutely delicious on a simple grilled sausage; critical in certain recipes.  This product bears no resemblance to the overprocessed, over-colored, over-sugared GLOP that passes for mustard in this country; the mustard seeds are whole and fill your mouth with flavor. Subtly different from Dijon mustard, which is made with white wine, Moutarde Meaux is made with vinegar and the added tang is just sublime...  No pantry should be without it, and you will never, ever go back to the yellow stuff.",5
B0001BH5YM,"I love this mustard! It has a tangy flavor that enhances every food it is paired with. The appearance is unlike traditional yellow mustard, this mustard looks like tiny seeds with a small amount of clear liquid. The result is perfection - smooth with a bold flavor that is something like a ""wasabi mustard."" The thing is, it is REAL mustard, not a modern interpretation.

If you do not want to become addicted to it and forget that any other variety exists then don't try it.  You can nitpick the ingredients, the regional availability and/or the price if you want but at the end of the day, you are just not going to find another ready to eat chili from a store shelf that is this delicious.<br /><br />Also, remember that it's just NOT <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JM3G"">Peggy</a>'s world famous Frito Pie without the Wolf Brand! Stock up!",5
B001BCVEBU,"We were fortunate enough many years ago to spend a year in Texas which is where we discovered Wolf Brand Chili.  Throughout our many moves over the years, which have been coast to coast literally from Florida to Alaska, we have sought out Wolf Brand Chili and frequently have ordered it when it was not locally available.  I just want to be really clear THIS IS THE BEST CANNED CHILI IN THE ENTIRE WORLD, no I am SERIOUS.  Really no kidding this is not greasy or nasty or made with cheap garbage instead its got a full yummy flavor.  There are flavors for everyone our family eats 3 different flavors, I eat the beanless my husband favors the one with beans although I try to limit that, and our kids like the hot/spicy one, with rice, with cracks its quick its awesome.  We cant get it where we live now so we order it from Amazon.<br />One more time just in case there was maybe a bit of confusion THIS IS THE BEST CANNED CHILI IN THE ENTIRE WORLD!  at least what is sold in the US)",5
B001BCVEBU,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVEBU"">Wolf  Chili with Beans, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />I like this product, and I'll continue to buy it, unless and until I find something better. Having said that, I'm not quite satisfied with it in one respect: its hotness, or lack thereof. I like my chili hot, and this chile fails in that department. Unfortunately, I'm not a cook, and my attempts to ""spice it up"" have not yet worked, but I'll keep trying. So far I've tried powdered chili, and ground-up fresh jalapeno chile, but I didn't like the results. I know that there must be some percentage of some kind of additional hotness that will make it perfect, but I haven't found it yet. Something to look forward to.<br /><br />One more thought on my personal ""hotness"" meter. At one point I did read the label to make sure that it contained chile. I really hadn't been sure about that, but it does.",4
B001BCVEBU,"The flavor is OK, but this chili is very greasy tasting and Ok at best.  I like the Campbell's Roadhouse and Firehouse line much better.  Taste is very subjective, of course, but I do not see this as the stellar chili others are claiming it to be.  My 2 cents and feel free to disagree.  It does grow on you and I liked it better as I ate it over time, but I would not buy it again.  My kids liked it fine, though.",3
B001BCVEBU,"I've previously had this on Subscribe & Save (last year) but the next time I went to order it had been dropped from S&S.  Recently noticed that it was back on S&S again and decided to order it.  I received the order fairly quickly and as usual some cans were damaged. To the point that at least one of them I will not be able to open.  Amazon MUST do something about the way they package this stuff.  I discovered another disconcerting thing.  What I received in the can I would not call Chili, but maybe Chili Soup.  Unlike all of the Wolf Brand Chili I have ever had in the past this product poured out of the can.  In the past I would have to spoon out the chili and beans to get it out of the can.  Wolf Brand has reduced the meat and beans and is using more water.  WB's quality has diminished.<br /><br />UPDATED:<br /><br />Since unloading the case I have discovered that every single can is dented, some worse than others, a couple likely beyond opening.  I also wonder if the contents would be safe to eat.  The drop in quality of the product is bad enough but the state of the delivery is unacceptable. I'll be contacting Amazon about this.  They shouldn't sell canned goods if they can't deliver them properly.  Buyer beware!",1
B001BCVEBU,I have loved Wolf Brand Chili since I was little.  I order it on-line because I can't find it in Florida.  I love it and can't eat hotdogs without it.,5
B001BCVEBU,"I love chili, preferably with beans, since that is the way I grew up.  I crumble a half a sleeve of crackers in it, and I can not get enough of it.  I have tried all the manufactured cans of chili, and this manufacture is the king of canned chili, Wolf  brand chili!",5
B001BCVEBU,Another Tex-Mex item that has no substitute. We bugged our Minnesota Target store about it until they started carrying it. It's great!!,5
B001BCVEBU,"For this Texan living many years in NYC, good canned chili is a necessity when I don't have time to make my own. The national brands have been blanded down too much. Wolf's -- made in Texas bit not available in supermarkets in NYC --  is one of the very few which doesn't need to have additional chili powder to be hot enough.  I'm glad to be able to get it thru Amazon at a reasonable price with free postage.",4
B001BCVEBU,I bought this Wolf Chili with Beans after reading several of the reviews.  I am so glad that I did.  This is good chili.  My husband and I have slathered it over tamales and spaghetti and corn chips.  The possibilities are endless.  We thought that Hormel Chili was the best.  Turns out that we prefer the Wolf Chili with Beans.  We are keeping this item on our shelves and will continue order this fine chili.,5
B001BCVEBU,"I have been an addict on Steak n Shake chilli all my life. I even found a clone home made receipe for Steak n Shake chilli on the net.. It was good but just not the same as the real deal. Then I found Wolfbrand in Krogers next to Steak n Shake chilli. It was $1.79 for a 15oz can and the Steak N Shake chilli was $3.59 for a 15oz can. In my brain, someone somewhere told me to try it but havent seen it in my area anywhere.<br />After consuming and comparing both Steak N Shake and Wolfbrand I can say Wolfbrand tastes almost exactly like Steak N Shake chilli. I say almost tastes the same is because Steak N Shake has cumin in it. Otherwise exactly the same. I add some cumin to the Wolfbrand when I prepair it and there you go. Awesume stuff. Now the price at Amazon on Wolfbrand chilli ends up being $2.12 a 15oz can if you get 24 cans @ $50.95. So if you could save  $1.80 a can if you shop around. I give this Wolfbrand product a 5 star.",5
B001BCVEBU,i wish someone here in their review would have told me that this is HOT chili.  i'm sure there are plenty who like it that way....but i am not one of them.  not saying its bad chili.....just know that it is HOT!!!,3
B001BCVEBU,"Wolf Chili is the best canned chili you can buy.  It works with hot-dogs, noddles, rice or just in a cup for lunch.  I would recommend this product to anyone...",5
B001BCVEBU,"I have never rated anything on Amazon before, but I was very impressed by this chili.  I have tried many different canned chilies and have found most of them are like a bland bean soup.  My favorite before trying Wolf's was Amy's vegetarian (and I am NOT a vegetarian) just because it had some flavor.  You can't get any better chili unless you make it yourself.",5
B001BCVEBU,"I bought an entire freaking CASE of this based on my memories and to show my hubby how ""totally awesome"" it was.... ugh!!!!! big mistake. Don't get me wrong, this is good canned chili. It's basically like most good canned chilies.... good and straight from a can. Don't get wrapped up in memories of the first time you ate it with an ex-boyfriend who told you it was the best ever because it's not AND don't ever brag to the heavens to your hubby that it's the BEST because you will be taken down a few notches like I was.<br /><br />Yes, I admit, what was I thinking or drinking when I decided WOLF was best ever because it's just like the rest.<br /><br />:(<br /><br />It's just like me... wah!",3
B001BCVEBU,"My case of Wolf chili arrived yesterday. Lets start with that. HEY AMAZON, whoever works in your shipping department should be fired. This case of chili was in a box about 8 inches larger than the case itself, no problem there. But only 1 piece of brown packing paper was used, and it was placed on top of the chili. There was no packing around the sides of the case, so this chili was sliding around in this box and tearing the box up. A few of the cans were dented, but no problem there. I worked in shipping and receiving before, and if anything was packed in this manner, it would be totally unacceptable. I am surprised UPS even accepted the package the way the case was sliding around in the box. Ok, enough of that. On to the chili itself.<br /><br />I bought this because I had read so many reviews about how Wolf chili is supposed to be the best. Well, I gotta say that it doesnt even come close to the best. First of all, open the can and pour it into the pot. Thats right, pour. The consistency of this chili is almost like soup. Any other can of chili you would either have to shake vigorously out of the can or spoon it out, but this stuff just pours out. And I think there was beef in it, but it must have been ground up so small that it was hardly noticable, again, adding to that watery consistency.<br /><br />As for the taste, well, it aint bad, but again, nowhere near the best. But the consistency of the chili and the taste combined? Makes you wonder how anyone can rave about this stuff. 4/10 at best, and thats being kind.<br /><br />If you want the best, I would go with Stagg. Many different flavors and a much higher quality, and better consistency.",2
B001BCVEBU,"I was raised and lived in Texas for more than 40 years. Wolf brand chili was by far the most popular canned chili. Tastes so close to home made. It is not available in Nevada where I now live so when I saw it for sale on Amazon, I bought a case. I am so glad to have a source for it now.",5
B001BCVEBU,"Bought a case after seeing the many great reviews of this chili....to me it's average at best. It's very pasty, with no real definition of meat, beans, or tomatoes. Almost pureed, like Hormel's chili....I will say I like it on hot dogs for that reason, but to eat as a stand alone dish...not so much. Doesn't compare to the Firehouse chili I buy in the grocery store.",3
B001BCVEBU,"It isn't greasy tasting, it's thick and damn good. I was vert surprised it held up to the gtreat reviews.  I added a few dried onions to it while cooking for ten minutes, the slight crisy and sweetness of the onion makes it taste as good as a restaurants.<br /><br />UPDATE...A week later I ate another serving, only I ate the whole can instead of only ten ounces....8 hours later my body was forced to regurgetate it. This has not happened to me since I ate some really greasy spicy chicken wings for lunch at work in 1993. I spit it into a paper towel, it was orange grease, I fear the same orange grease that rises to the top of most other canned chili's that I am able to mostly skim-off  This chili showed very little solid grease at the top, I could not quickly remove it, so I didn't. I suspect it had just as much but was emulsified into the thicker sauce, which I ended up eating and then regurgitating because my body could not digest it. I wish I hadn't eaten it. Now I have 22 cans more which I will be afraid to eat unless I can figure out how to easily get rid of some of the hidden grease.",5
B000EVIDK4,"easy to use- i make with water, adding a tsp of canola oil- it thickens fast, and tastes oh so very good- i am a vegetarian, but meat eaters will love this, too- it is really good on potatoes, baked or boiled or mashed, and even frenchfried! this product is GREAT!",5
B000EVIDK4,I have been searching for a mix for vegetarian gravy with a beef type flavor.  This is the best I have found.  The mock chicken version by Hain is not to my liking so if you have tried that one don't let it prevent you from enjoying the brown gravy mix.  Whole Foods used to carry in bulk mix for chicken broth/gravy that was very good but seems to have discontinued it.  The only vegetarian gravy better than this brown gravy mix comes with a tofurkey that is mushroom gravy that is prepared and frozen.  This is simple and handy and relatively inexpensive and as tasty as any meat based gravy mix.,5
B000EVIDK4,This product is cheaper than if you can find it in the stores. It's easy to make and taste great for adding flavor to foods or just use as gravy.,5
B000EVIDK4,"This gravy is great over mashed potatoes and also terrific when you add a couple of packets to a big pot of vegetable stew. Low fat, too!",5
B000EVIDK4,Perfect on tofu turkey and mash potatoes during the holidays.  I've tried various other vegetarian gravies and this is by far my favorite gravy!,5
B000EVIDK4,"This stuff is so good, I've ordered it through ""Subscribe & Save"" so I never run out. It rivals any meat-based brown gravy mix on the market.<br /><br />When I want a less ""heavy"" or intense flavor, I combine this with Hain's Chicken gravy mix (simply by using one pack of each). Frankly, the combined version is my favorite--lighter than the Brown on its own and richer than the Chicken on its own. It's my go-to, all-purpose gravy recipe. Give it a try!",5
B000EVIDK4,This brown gravy is delicious and perfect for vegetarians.  I cannot get it at my health food store anymore so it's nice to know I can order it on Amazon.,5
B000EVIDK4,I have purchased this gravy and used it with my homemade vegetarian salisbury steak recipe.  It was fantastic and flavorful.  Best yet was that my guest didn't even know his meal was vegetarian.  He went back for 3rd's.,5
B000EVIDK4,Bought this because the nutrition facts indicated that it had no sodium content.  WRONG!  All kinds of sodium.  What a waste of money.,1
B000EVIDK4,"I order these for my mom, who doesn't use the internet. I always shop for the best price - and this is it!",5
B000EVIDK4,"I love this gravy.  It's hard to find tasty veggie gravy in a packet.  However, this item took 7 days to ship- meaning that I received an email that it was being shipped 7 days after I ordered it.  I received the package a few days after that.",4
B000EVIDK4,"This is the best vegetarian gravy mix I have found. I have tried many others, but this one is the best. And it is so easy to use, just add water.",5
B000EVIDK4,I bought this as a substitute to the gravy mix I did use (bought at Sams Club) that had monsodium glutenage (?) in it...I used it spread on top of roast when cooked in a dutch oven.  The Hain Pure Foods Vegetarian Brown Gravy Mix was a good substitute...I recommend it.,5
B000EVIDK4,"This product is a useful and tasty alternative to making my own gravy from scratch. Sometimes I just want to eat some potatoes with gravy but I don't have all the ingredients to make gravy, or the time.<br /><br />Aside from pairing this gravy with potatoes, I love to make vegetarian SOS.<br />Here is what I do:<br />-Sourdough toast<br />-Veggie burger chopped up and sauteed or Veggie Crumbles, sauteed<br />-Gravy<br /><br />My other variation for this gravy is for a faux Stroganoff.<br />- Egg Noodles<br />- Veggie steak or Veggie Crumbles Sauteed with diced mushrooms in olive oil or butter<br />- Gravy<br />- Top with a dollop of cream cheese, vegetarian ""sour cream,"" or vegetarian greek yogurt.<br /><br />I bought this product as a warehouse deal, and I almost feel guilty for paying such a low price. At Whole Foods, these are more than twice the cost here at Amazon.<br /><br />Enjoy!",5
B000EVIDK4,"This is good gravy, and since all my kids are vegetarians, they will eat it!  In addition, ordering this product from Amazon is MUCH CHEAPER than buying it in a store..........<br /><br />Not as good as REAL gravy, but close!",4
B000EVIDK4,"Hain's brown gravy is the perfect storm of accomplishments you don't normally associate with vegetarian food.  It tastes like the real thing; it's easy to make; it's inexpensive (~$1 a pack); and it's relatively easy to find: my local grocer carries it  -  but if yours doesn't, it's also lightweight and easy to ship.<br /><br />""Savory"" and ""hearty"" are two of the harder-to-come-by tastes in the vegetarian palette, and there's nothing to remedy that dearth like a big bowl of mashed potatoes and gravy.  Plus, it's satisfyingly gloppy.  Few vegetarian foods promise such delightful slop and unhealth.  (The gravy is in truth disappointingly healthy, but you can pretend.)<br /><br />(Hain's chicken gravy is acceptable but not as successful, though, so watch it.)",5
B000EVIDK4,"To make this less salty (as gravies tend to be), we add one extra cup of water, a tablespoon of corn starch, plus herb seasoning. One visitor licked the plate.....",5
B000EVIDK4,"You need to understand that I haven't had gravy in nearly 20 years.  Up until that point, mashed potatoes & gravy were my singular most favoritest thing in the world.  Twenty years.<br /><br />I found this stuff while browsing at Whole Foods, went home and made it up, and O.M.G.  The clouds parted, the sun shone, and God himself smiled down upon me and granted me the most miraculous vegetarian gift I'd been given in a very long time.<br /><br />I returned to Whole Foods the next day and bought five more packets.",5
B000EVIDK4,"I looked all over the city here in Portland, Oregon and could not find a good tasting veggie gravy mix.  Then, a friend suggested Hain Brown Gravy Mix. I'm glad I found this product. I have served this to a lot of people.  And, everyone has complemented the gravy.  Very close to the real thing.<br /><br />Great Product. Thank you Hain!",5
B0010Y6QBC,"This product changed my life. I don't love the taste of the juice or the powder, and these pills are raw and live and work just as well. When taken on a daily basis I find myself feeling so incredibly much better! I have put them on my monthly recurring list to purchase.",5
B0010Y6QBC,"I bought these because I didn't like the powder and having to run out and buy orange juice to mix it with every so often.  The powder is one thing, but I can pop pills all day.  It's nice that these have the same benefits as the powder and they're more convenient for me.  When I bought the powder, I also have a capsule maker that I use but it is time consuming to make x amount of capsules.",4
B0010Y6QBC,I was very pleasantly surprised at the rapid and positive changes in my daily health from using this product.  Energy and mood improved with a couple of hours of taking the first dose.  Digestion has also improved.  I am now using this product twice a day (5 caps at a time) and juicing fresh wheatgrass once a day.  The benefits of both are well worth the cost,5
B0010Y6QBC,"I love this stuff.  This is the first I have tried wheat grass and what a difference in my energy level.  I take it first thing in the a morning and I am good to go!  Even my friends wonder why I have so much energy.  I say, buy this!",5
B0010Y6QBC,what they dont tell you is they say 10 pills a day you should take. a serving size is 5. But its still better then the powder,4
B0010Y6QBC,"For years i tried to wake up at 6 am, but 7.30 was the earliest i could do. I was tired and sleepy most of the time. After just 1 week of taking Wheatgrass, i am fully awake at ...5 am !!!! And  my energy is back! Awesome!!!! Doesnt taste as bad as people say. Maybe the powder does, but the pills are chewy and taste like, well, grass. I take it before breakfast and lunch with lots of water. I felt tired and thirsty first 3 days, but i guess it was toxins leaving my body. This Amazing Grass is truly AMAZING!!!",5
B0010Y6QBC,I started taking wheatgrass tablets and noticed a slight change in my energy level. I stopped for about 2 weeks and boy did I notice a difference. Without them I was so tired and it was all I could do to go for my daily 2 mile walk. I really do believe in this product. And it is cheaper on Amazon that at your health foods store.,5
B0010Y6QBC,"My herbal doctor recommended wheatgrass for energy, detoxification, and stress reduction.  That sounds like a lot of benefits.  I was eager to try it out.<br /><br />I take two of these pills in the morning and two at lunch, along with some organic spirulina I bought here on Amazon.  Together, I do notice a little boost of energy - helping me awaken in the morning pre-coffee, and helping perk me up after lunch.<br /><br />I will purchase another bottle of each supplement and continue, since I feel it is working.<br /><br />Note: if you like the powder form, you can use that - Amazing Grass makes some of that too.  Or if you have a masticating juicer (like an Omega), you can juice wheatgrass.  Personally, I find pill form easiest to sustainably take each day - and like with many supplements, if you don't take them regularly, they won't work as well.",5
B0010Y6QBC,"I bought this since I read about the more than positive reviews. My husband and 5 yr old take this daily as a shake added to our oatmeal and although we have not seen a change in our energy level, we seen a lot of movement in the bathroom arena. I gave it a 4 because I have not seen any energy change yet, which is really why I bought it. If our energy level explodes then I will change my rating.",4
B0010Y6QBC,"I purchased powdered beverage mix and these tablets.  I try to get in at least one serving of a wheat grass product each day.  If I can't make the mix product then these tablets are quick and easy.  You have to take each one quickly because if you let them hang around in your mouth for even a few seconds you'll begin to get the flavor, which isn't bad but I prefer to get them down ASAP.  I do not find the tablets to be too large.",4
B0010Y6QBC,"My brother-in-law grows his own wheat grass and he suggested I try it to help with the eczema on my hands.  I couldn't quite handle the juice so when I saw the tablets were available I ordered those.  I must admit I did notice a difference right away in how I felt....had a lot more energy and not too long after starting the tablets I did notice a slight improvement in how my hands felt.  I am going to continue taking them, what's to lose??",4
B0010Y6QBC,"I have yet to try actual wheat grass, but from what I hear its pretty hard to get down.<br /><br />Not to mention, its hard to find (even harder to find it in stores made organically), you wont get much juice out of it when juicing, and costly if you do happen to find it.<br /><br />I like that I can just pop 4 of these wheat grass pills and call it a day.<br /><br />I don't take the recommended 5 pills because I eat enough other veggies throughout the day including kale.<br /><br />I haven't noticed much increased energy from using these pills, and on the few days here and there I forgot to take them I didn't fell any different either.<br /><br />Some thing I take, I notice I feel much different on the days I forgot or don't take them, but with these I did not notice a difference in my body.<br /><br />But overall, wheat grass is super healthy for you, and these amazing Grass tablet make it easy to get a good organic dose of them. I recommend.",4
B0010Y6QBC,Just started taking these last week and so far I am pleased with this product. Already they have aided with digestion issues and I'm hoping that over time they will give me an energy boot and strengthen immune system as well,5
B0010Y6QBC,It is very important to include whole food supplements in our diets. Love this product! I would recommend it to others.,5
B0010Y6QBC,"I have been taking this for several months. When I first started taking them I couldn't sleep at night...I had so much energy. Now I take first in the morning 5 at a time and I'm good. There is no after taste, they are big but easily swallowed. I believe they have helped everything in my clean eating lifestyle. I think they are so much easier to do than drink the powered version. I will keep purchasing them and recomend them to everyone for a healthy lifestyle. Enjoy!!",5
B0010Y6QBC,"I have been purchasing a lot of stuffs from amazon but never left any reviews, this is the one I have to say it is amazing!  It stopped (or cured?) my husband's pollen allergy. He used to take all kinds of allergy pills trying to stop sneezing, watery eyes and runny nose, but no medicine could attack all the symptoms. For 5,6 years, He had to take many different kinds of medicine... And this year, his symptom got worse. We got the info about how wheatgrass can stop allergy and boost energy, so he started taking 10 tablets a day, before he finished the first bottle, his pollen allergy's gone! His brother and mom who also suffered from pollen allergy for many years, took wheatgrass as well(they drank juice), they are pollen allergy-free now! I gave half bottle to one of my neighbors and her allergy stopped too! Having said that,  it doesn't stop my husband's seafood allergy. Originally we were just thinking instead of buying medicine, why not spend the money on natural remedies? It wont mess up you body like medicines, and If it doesn't work we will just go back to medicine... But it worked! If you are suffering from pollen allergy, I strongly suggest you try wheatgrass!(any brand organic or grow by yourselves but not the ones you buy at juice stand cause they've been harvest hundred times and had no nutrition at all!)",5
B0010Y6QBC,Let me just say that I really love Amazing Grass as a company.  I love that they have a good rep and put out quality wheat grass supplements.  I was so happy to find tablets as the powder doesn't always sit right with me though I do use that on occasion.  The serving size of these are FIVE huge pills.  I take them everyday with my latte to wash them down.  I wish they were a bit smaller but it's not such an issue.  I really do recommend these especially if you can't stand fresh or powdered wheat grass.,4
B0010Y6QBC,"I hate to bad mouth a product; but for me, this product did not help me.  Many people believe in the immune system properties in Wheat Grass.  I do not see it.  I prefer Elderberry, this works for me.  Maybe Wheat Grass helps others.",3
B0010Y6QBC,"I am gluten sensitive -- I get migraines from wheat. I am able to take some wheat grass products but not others. On the Amazing Grass website, they swear it's gluten-free. Having tried this product today and getting a migraine shortly afterward, I can tell you it's NOT gluten free.",1
B000WL58J0,"These taste great however, some individuals are sensitive to sugar alcohols and their blood glucose will climb after eating these, mine went through the roof after I ate these.  Monitor your blood glucose carefully the first time you eat these or any other snack that claims to be sugar free but contains sugar alcohols.",3
B000WL58J0,"If you want to avoid visiting the porcelain throne after eating these, follow a couple of simple rules:<br /><br />- Don't consume these on an empty stomach - have them after you have eaten something first.  An after meal dessert is perfect for these candies, as are any candies containing maltitol.<br />- Limit your consumption - don't eat the whole bag.<br /><br />If you ignore one or both of these rules, be prepared to clear your schedule for the inevitable bathroom visit.",4
B000WL58J0,"The package says ""Individuals sensitive to sugar substitutes may experience a laxative effect."" I paid no attention, since there were no ingredients I hadn't eaten before with no problem.<br /><br />That was a serious mistake! Without going into details, I certainly experienced 'a laxative effect'.<br /><br />I don't know if it is the combination of ingredients, or the relative amounts, or what. I would not call myself sensitive to sugar substitutes ordinarily. But I certainly won't be ordering these again!",1
B000WL58J0,Reese's Sugar-free Peanut Butter Cups taste just like the regular ones. Plus they are lower in sugars and are healthier.  Great prices on Amazon too.,5
B000WL58J0,"My husband is gluten sensitive, dairy sensitive, and diabetic.  And, he has a sweet tooth.  We were thrilled to find that these candies are allowed with all of his eating issues.  Plus, they are GOOD!  Thanks to Amazon for carrying them.",5
B000WL58J0,I just bought and tried the product and i really liked the taste ... almost similar to the normal ones. I will definateley purchase again.,5
B000WL58J0,"Since these are mostly sweetened with Maltitol, not artificial sweeteners, they have no strange aftertaste and taste like the real thing.  Excellent snack if you are watching carbs.  The ENTIRE bag has 2g of net carbs.",5
B000WL58J0,I'm a Reese's peanut butter cup addict needing to control my diet.  This is my perfect compromise.,5
B000WL58J0,"The Reese's Sugar Free Peanut Butter Chocolate Miniatures taste very close to their full sugar counterparts. These are really very good and I have enjoyed being able to snack on ""Reese's Cups"" again (being a Type 2 diabetic).<br /><br />One note of caution, eating too many of these do cause me some gastric distress. This might vary from person to person, but you might want to be cautious the first time you try them.<br /><br />Recommended!",4
B000WL58J0,"These are great.  You can't even tell that they are sugar free.  Everyone that I give them too, loves them also.",5
B000WL58J0,"Poor tasting, mushy feel, not like what I thought they'd be like and unlike other similar products. Description certainly didn't fit taste--maybe it was oversold by this seller? Didn't like them and I usually like peanut butter and chocolate so must be this or the handling.",1
B000WL58J0,"The shipping box contains 12 bags of awesome chocolate/peanut butter cups.<br /><br />Each mini cup is individually wrapped in foil.<br /><br />They look just like the picture, and the taste....<br /><br />Well, the taste is fantastic. Almost too fantastic, Me and the kid gobbled em down at warp speed.<br /><br />These things didn't last long......",5
B000WL58J0,"I was quite skeptical about these little treats when I first saw them, but I have to say that these are a great treat if you are missing a little candy treat on the Atkins or a reduced sugar diet.  Be aware that you cannot sit there and eat the whole bag as you will pay for your gluttony at the throne of the porcelain god.  So only eat 1 or 2, then put the bag down. FYI, some people just cannot digest sugar alcohols without the GI side effects or migraines so you might want to try out a little bag of these from the store before you buy in bulk from Amazon.  Overall, great treat if you are minimally effected by sugar alcohols.",5
B000WL58J0,"they really taste like the real thing, just subtle differences.. the peanut butter is a bit more smooth and a bit less moist/gritty then the real thing, but it's subtle. There's also an ever so slight, barely noticeable 'sugar alcohol cool' effect. My only suggestion would be to use Erythritol as the sweetener, since that has the least calories and least issues with digestion, since it's excreted via the kidneys.  Like all 'sugar free' foods that contain any sugar alcohol other then Erythritol, these will have a laxative effect.",4
B000WL58J0,"I thought these would be a good substitute for the ""real"" variety without all the sugar.  And they were yummy.  However, after eating 3 of them I felt very bad.  I've NEVER had any reaction to sugar free products or sugar alcohols before.  It's been 2 hours now of feeling like vomiting and/or running to the bathroom.  Beware!!!",2
B000WL58J0,"I picked up a bag of this candy at the store this evening and ate some of it.  I cannot believe how sick I was.  I had severe diarrhea, stomach pain, and vomiting. I did some googling and apparently these are the effects of the sugar alchohol maltitol. I can't believe this ingrediant is even allowed and the only warning on the label was small, on the back, and something about individuals who are sensitive could experience a laxative effect.  Seriously? I will never again buy a product that contains maltitol.",1
B000WL58J0,No problems with this transaction in any way.<br />All went without a hitch and the product was just as listed.,5
B000WL58J0,"Sucralose is the artificial sweetener in this candy that replaces sugar, and if you do the research, you find that sucralose is not a healthy alternative.<br /><br />James Turner, the chairman of the national consumer education group Citizens for Health, has expressed shock and outrage after reading a new report from scientists outlining the dangers of the artificial sweetener Splenda (sucralose).<br /><br />In animals examined for the study, Splenda reduced the amount of good bacteria in the intestines by 50 percent, increased the pH level in the intestines, contributed to increases in body weight and affected P-glycoprotein (P-gp) levels in such a way that crucial health-related drugs could be rejected.",1

B000LKTXIO,"I love this bread. First, I was concerned that it might arrive in million pieces but every package was in perfect condition and no slice of bread had crumbs. I am buying this bread since years and we eat a lot of it.",5
B000LKTXIO,"This came up in a ""gluten-free bread"" search. We ordered, but the label reveals this bread contains barley kernels.  Gluten is contained within the kernel.  So while it may be ""wheat free""  this bread is Not Gluten-Free!<br />Really cannot comment on taste, will have to return.",1
B000LKTXIO,I grew up in Denmark and was raised on whole grain bread which I then never found here.  But this is just like what I grew up with.  Great.,5
B000LKTXIO,"I am addicted to this bread! Ever since I tasted it in Germany more than 4 years ago, I have been hooked and love the convenience and value of buying it on amazon.  I have tried other varieties offered by Mestemacher, including Fitness Bread and Sunflower-Seed Bread but the Three-Grain is hands-down my favorite. I love how there are NO preservatives or chemicals added- just delicious and nutritious whole grains (which yeast and salt).",5
B000LKTXIO,"Finally we have access to some good German bread.<br />We live in rural Arkansas and do not have access to stores like Whole Foods nor to specialty bakeries, so our ability to secure this bread through Amazon is a godsend.<br />The bread arrived fresh, generally well sealed - a couple of the 36 loaves got mildew on them within a few days.<br />When considering a healthy diet, this is the best you can get, I think, in terms of bread.<br />Generally we make open-faced sandwiches. We also cut these sandwiches into small squares to serve on a platter to guests.<br />The bread contains no ""undesirable"" additives such as dough conditioners or preservatives.",5
B000LKTXIO,"I was a bit hesitant ordering this because you have to buy so much at once. BUT, the bread is wonderful, and because my daughter is allergic to wheat it has been a great relief to her.  It is most wonderful toasted, and freezes/recovers well.<br />A great product - high fiber, high nutrition, etc.  Thanks!!!",5
B000LKTXIO,"It is delightfully convenient to buy bread on Amazon.com!  It is also very nice to be able to buy EUROPEAN bread.  I don't remember what health-food book I read this in, but, in passing, this book mentioned that Americans, (especially American children), who visit Europe are often heard to joyfully be saying: ""Have you tasted the BREAD?!!!!!""<br /><br />MESTERNACHER THREE-GRAIN BREAD is my first European bread.  It is tasty, (I was afraid I wouldn't like the taste) -- yet, my American taste still would like a sweeter bread.  Still, not bad tasting at all.  The truly wonderful thing about this bread, however, is that IT CONTAINS NO WHEAT!  Wheat has its place in the diet, I suppose...but limiting it is important, because, amongst other things, wheat is said to be bad for people with arthritis of ANY kind, and wheat is also said to be bad for ANYONE'S eyes.  I'm not too knowedgeable about wheat's good and bad qualties -- but I do know the above two facts.  I also have heard bad things about wheat GLUTEN.  Presumably, wheat products without the gluten are better than those with gluten. Mestermacher Three-Grain Bread, however, has NO WHEAT AT ALL.  So, one does not have to worry about any bad effects of wheat, at all!<br /><br />What does this bread have in it, if it doesn't have wheat?  The ingredient list is:<br /><br />Whole Kernel Rye<br />Water<br />Wholemeal Rye Flour<br />Oat Kernels<br />Barley Kernels<br />Linseed<br />Salt<br />Oat Fibre<br />Sesame<br />Yeast<br /><br />It is mentioned underneath the ingredients list that this bread containes Sesame.  Obviously, some people are allergic to sesame.  And, perhaps, some of the other ingredients?  Anyway, the ingredient list is above...and, of course, on each loaf wrapper.<br /><br />Also listed are special attributes of this bread:<br /><br />No preservatives<br />Kosher = K parev<br />High Fibre<br />Cholesterol Free<br />Natural Ingredients<br />Long Shelf Life<br />Wheat Free<br /><br />The second-to-the-last attribute, ""Long Shelf Life"" is due to the fact that THIS BREAD IS PASTEURIZED. (But, as mentioned above, it still tastes pretty good, unlike many other pasteurized products....)  The expiration date on the bread I have bought, is 12 - 12 - 2010 -- NINE MONTHS from the day I first opened the package, (YESTERDAY), and ate my first piece!<br /><br />Opened loaves, (there are 12 in the package), must be refrigerated, and eaten within 4 days.  But each loaf contains only 7 slices!  This makes it easy to eat the entire (nice and thinly-sliced) loaf in the required 4 days. It' interesting that there are SEVEN pieces in each loaf.  Usually, of course, it takes TWO pieces of any type of bread to make a sandwich.....<br /><br />But this bread is NOT shaped square-ishly, like most American breads.  No, as can clearly be seen from the photos here, it is RECTANGULARLY shaped.  This would seem to make it easy to simply slice the bread in half, and make a small sandwhich from the two pieces.  However, the texture of this bread will not allow this. Or, at least the texture of the bread I bought will not allow this.  As I said, the bread I have has a shelf-life of NINE months (left?).  I have no idea how long the bread's shelf-life is, when it first is baked.  IF it is one year, than I am missing three months -- and the bread, though fresh(ish?) is very, (very) slightly brittle. As a single-slice, it breaks off neatly, but if I was to try to cut it in half, and make a sandwich, I'm sure many, many crumbs would result.  Maybe this would happen even if the bread were at its freshest: the picture on the wrapper shows an OPEN-FACED sandwich ""serving suggestion"", using only one piece of bread....<br /><br />Or perhaps, because of the ALL-natural ingredients, no ""dough conditioners"" or other ingredients to make the bread soft enough to ""fold"", as most American breads do.  I wish a natural dough-conditioner, (or other ingredient), could be found, so that this fine, natural bread, would be as pliable as American breads are.<br /><br />I guess this ""unfoldability"" is my main complaint about this bread, and why I give it only 4 stars.  It is, however, quite good tasting, (minus the American-type sweetness I, personally, so enjoy), and it does make one feel good that one is NOT eating wheat, and is enjoying all-natural ingredients, and a high-fibre content, whilst eating this tasty bread!",4
B000LKTXIO,I love this product since I have used it before but it arrived with half the packages in crumbs and I am not happy.,5
B000LKTXIO,"i highly recommend this german whole grain bread. it is moist, chewy and tastes great cold or slightly toasted. the hardest part for a german living in the USA is to find good bread, because we are spoiled by the 100+  varieties in our home country. besides baking my own bread it is nice to have something ready to eat. i keep the 12 packages in our fridge and share them only with good friends who appreciate the taste of dark bread. the Mestemacher breads are the best deal on amazon.com because you get 17.6 oz packages (500g)...that's a german lb of bread in each package. i recommend cheeses, sausages etc as toppings, or just plain good butter. personally i do not like sweet toppings like jelly, honey on this bread.",5
B000LKTXIO,Love this bread but maybe it's not something that should be shipped.  I received the 12 packages and every pkg was mostly in crumbs. I was able to salvage a part of each slice. Also maybe it was too warm to be shipping.,2
B000LKTXIO,Remove the hot toasted bread and immediately rub garlic on both sides which generally takes one whole pealed large clove.  We also place sheep or goat cheese on it in the toaster oven until the former is melted completely.  This lead us to make mini-pizzas which we also enjoy since normal pizzas are wheat flour based. Don't forget Mestemacher also has this an ORGANIC three-grain bread which is about a third higher in price for those of you who try to keep to an organic foodsource regimen.  This is a great way to enjoy both worlds at the same time. I can't tell any difference in taste between these two breads.  Dr. Hatfield,5
B000LKTXIO,"This bread is just what the ""Doctor Ordered"".<br />I was looking for this type bread in the local stores and was not happy<br />with what I found.<br />So, I tried Amazon.  Sure enough there it is, Good Price too.",5
B000LKTXIO,"I just like bread that is natural, gives you something to chew and not bite off a piece sqeeze it between toung and gum and swollow it. The chewing process is so important to the whole digestive procedure. Besides that the bread also has NO preservatives and still stocks very well. My kind of bread, I LOVE IT SO DOES MY FAMILY.<br />John Healthguruom@yahoo.com",5
B000LKTXIO,I like this kind of bread and will order as long and as often as I can afford it.  I came from Europe and am use to this kind of bread. Try it you may just like it too.,5
B000LKTXIO,"Wonder Bread this is not! Authentic German-style bread it is. (Exactly what we eat when we're in Germany and Austria). For me, it's nutty, flavorful and healthy. Sometimes I spread olive oil with freshly ground basil (pesto) on it with a little Parmesan cheese on top, then lightly toast it in the toaster oven. It doesn't get much better than this! (Maybe you have to acquire a taste for it, but I love it).",5
B000LKTXIO,I love this bread. Toasted with butter or just with some raspberry jam spread on it the tart rich flavor is an awesome treat that is actually good for you.,5
B000LKTXIO,"Love this brand of bread.  High in fiber, tastes great, makes the best toast.  Like the wonderful breads you find in Europe",5
B000LKTXIO,"This was the worst bread I have ever tasted in my life.  I do not believe the German people actually eat this stuff.  Since I was stuck with 12 loaves, I gave one to my brother, my sister, my nephew and a friend and they all hated it. Fortunately, my dogs like it so I am using it as dog treats.  Of course they both have coprophagia, which might explain why they like it.",1
B000LKTXIO,"My husband bought this bread for us to try and save money. When it arrived, the package was really heavy. Too heavy even for 12 loafs of bread. When I opened it, There were 12 packs (7 slices and very thin) of the bread. Each one weighing almost a pound. I took a bite and had to spit it out. It was AWFUL. Dry and tasteless. I really wish we could return the product. I DON'T recommend this product at all!!! Save your money!",1
B0002ARRCC,"I got this toy because I wanted my cat to work a little for his food.  This toy was not the cat-torturing puzzle I was hoping for.  Unfortunately, my cat figured out how to get the food out efficiently in under 3 minutes.  It's not terribly tricky as the toy is essentially a hollow plastic ball with a hole in one side.  Food comes out almost every time my cat taps the ball.  It comes out so easily, more comes out than he sometimes wants to eat in one sitting.  I often find little trails of kibble all over the living room.  Still, I guess having to tap the ball a few times to get his food is more work than just eating it out of a bowl.  Also, you can pry the ball open so that you can clean it, which is a plus.",2
B0002ARRCC,"I have a half-Siamese and he got the food out of the balls in record time. If you cat is smart, try plastic soda bottles with a few holes punched in them. These balls are just too easy for MENSA cats.",1
B0002ARRCC,"Great way to limit the amount of dry food your cat eats in one sitting as he/she needs to work to get his/her food out.<br /><br />Plus, it provides a bit of a challenge to them, therefore combatting having a bored kitty - a large problem with indoor cats.",5
B0002ARRCC,"I agree that this isn't terribly tricky and that cats can get the treats out relatively quickly, but they still love it and get very excited when they see me filling up their ""treat balls.""  Because of the ease of getting the food out I usually fill these up with their regular kibble and let them use it to get some or all of their morning meal-definitely more fun and more active than the usual hovering over the bowl.<br /><br />Instead of giving each of my cats their own treat ball, I've started to put one treat ball out at a time-it makes it more challenging and fun for them to have to chase and battle for access to the treat ball (assuming your cats get along as well as ours do.)  They make it like a game of soccer, and its very funny to see them trying to steal the ball from each other and to block the ball from being stolen while they chomp down the food that they have earned.  One of my cats even has figured out how to ""guard"" the ball by sitting on it while he is busy eating the treat that fell out.  Another has perfected the ""swat"".",4
B0002ARRCC,"I bought these for my cat to play with while I am at work, and she thinks they are great!  She gets very excited when I fill them up in the morning, and when I get home in the evening they are always empty.  She has a great time batting them around.  Highly recommended!",5
B0002ARRCC,"These treat balls were intended to make my fat cat less lazy.  Unfortunately, she has no interest even with her favorite treats inside.  My other, more curious and active cat loves it and will roll and roll the ball until empty.  Note: Don't fill up at before bed, will keep you up all night!",5
B0002ARRCC,"Saw this at a friend's house and knew it would be great for one of our cats (he's very fond of his food). After a few minutes he had the thing figured out and was dispensing his supper gradually. A great distraction for a food oriented cat. A little tricky to fill, and dispenses small round food pellets best.",4
B0002ARRCC,"I use this with regular dry cat food instead of putting it all into a bowl. With some cat food (like the Royal Canine Allergy versions) it's not quite so trivial to get the food out - maybe 1/2 hour to get a 1/6 of a cup out of one of these. Cat seems to enjoy the activity.<br /><br />With smaller round-shaped cat food (Wellness), the food comes out too easily.",4
B0002ARRCC,"This is a good idea for a product, but the design is poor.<br /><br />After I had ordered the 2-pack for around $7 with shipping, I found a 4-pack at the 99¢ store, so I felt that I paid too much.<br /><br />The design makes it difficult to put the two halves back together once you have loaded the food or treats.<br /><br />I would recommend cutting a small hole in a tennis ball. That is what I have done and my cat seems to like it better.<br /><br />If you still want this product, let me know, I'd be happy to send it to you for the price of the shipping.",2
B0002ARRCC,"I bought this because my cat likes to eat and has figured out how to cheat a non-ball type automatic food dispenser. The balls came in a package of 2 and upon trying to open one of the balls to put the treats in, the plastic broke. So, I filled the 2nd one and it took her about 5 minutes to get all the treats out.  I think she enjoyed it though, so will continue to use it. Any little challenge is better than none for this smart kitty. Why do they make cat toys out of such cheezy materials?",3
B0002ARRCC,"I bought this as a way to get my food-motivated kitty to eat his food slower, and it does the trick.  He loves this thing.  As for me, I think it's a simple decent product that does what it's supposed to.  The opening is relatively large, but I use it with a larger kibble like Max Cat ([...]) , or if using it with smaller kibble I use masking tape to make the opening smaller.  There's a similar product on the market with a variable-sized opening thhat i haven't yet tried, but this one works fine as long as it's with larger-sized kibble.  Easy to open and clean.",3
B0002ARRCC,I tried everything and my cats didnt bother with it. They let the stuff rot inside.,1
B0002ARRCC,It's too bad that cats aren't like dogs insofar as they will rip things to shreds for treats.  My cats got really bored with this after a while because not all treats fall out of the hole easily.  Maybe I need to get tastier treats!,4
B0002ARRCC,My cat loves this.  It also helps her to eat a little slower so that she doesn't throw up.....I little hard to open though.,4
B0002ARRCC,"Cat ""Go, Cat, Go!"" Treat Balls / B000197ZQW<br /><br />I love this idea - why did I never think of this until I got a puppy and a similar toy for him? Unfortunately, my 4 year old lazy kitties don't seem as interested as I would hope - they like to eat the treats that fall out when I shake it, but they won't chase the ball themselves. Are they too dumb to figure it out? Too lazy to exert the effort? I can't tell you. I think these are a great idea, and I will definitely keep them around in case we have another younger kitty come into the household - I have a hunch that a younger kitten would go after these like crazy!",4
B0002ARRCC,just the thing to keep that waste of fur busy for a few minutes in the morning. Place a couple of pieces of kitty crack (Bounce dry treats) in the ball and enjoy the cat getting the treat out.,5
B0002ARRCC,"I bought this for my small dogs (pugs) and it works really well. Much cheaper than other treat dispensers. There are other treat balls that are better because the design allows you to control how much kibble falls out at a time but for the price, this is a great product. Would definitely recommend.",5
B0002ARRCC,I purchased these little treat balls for my daughter's miniature schnouzer and he learned quickly to treat himself with these. He loves chasing them around too. Keeps him busy and out of trouble.,4
B0002ARRCC,I almost bought this for my cat i have been looking for a item like this at local stores so i placed the order and was reviewing everything i also bought several other items so did not think anything of the total until i looked at the invoice for this particular item the toy cost a 1.99 but they get you with shipping it was 6.55 bringing the total to 8.54. i thought it was overpriced and cancelled my order i guess it is buyer beware!!!!!,1
B0015MLVAA,"I won't say I'm an expert in cheese curls, but these sure taste great. Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Amazon price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective.<br /><br />UPDATE December 11, 2009<br />Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag ""freshness guaranteed."" That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I'll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients). I'd give this one star today if I could.",5
B0015MLVAA,"I'd give it three stars for the approximately 50% of puffs that have little or no cheese on them, and five stars for the ones that have a lot (maybe too much?). I have been eating Michael Seasons puffs and curls for at least two years and can't help but notice how their production has shifted from full-flavored to light-flavored (after which I wrote the company) to mixed-flavored. It seems they produce one batch of light and one batch of full flavored and then mix the two. Are they expecting nobody to notice? At least my wife loves to pick out the light flavored puffs leaving me the full flavored creating a kind of bonding experience if you will, but if I were eating this by myself I'd be annoyed. Still, because they contain at least partially organic ingredients, and because they taste so well overall, there's no other brand that beats them so I keep ordering anyway.",4
B0015MLVAA,"I am so disappointed- this product is NOT eligible to return, but the items I received were outdated!  The use by date was even BEFORE I submitted the order, and the seller sent product they should have seen were beyond the best by date- at least 6 weeks before they processed the order.",1
B0015MLVAA,"These are so intensely cheddary, they're addictive. I love them, they are everything I want in a cheese snack, very cheesy without being greasy or tasting artificial",5
B0015MLVAA,I had so hoped they would be close or better than Cheetos Flamin' Hot but they aren't. They were NOT past the expiration by  3 months but they did taste stale and almost flavorless even though you get a tiny after burn. I gave the rest of the case to the food shelter.,2
B0015MLVAA,"These are the best cheese puffs I have ever had, a sentiment shared by my coworkers and boss.",5
B0015MLVAA,"My husband and I went Gluten Free earlier this year due to a health condition.  We stumbled across this product at Whole Foods and decided to try it.  These were incredible...  so cheesy and spicy!!!  So much so, we decided to buy a case on Amazon.  Once our original case was depleted, we re-ordered, and though the product looks identical, the new case contained cheese curls with little to no seasoning.  They were so bland that we had no desire to eat them.  We opened each bag in the case hoping some of them would be good like the first case we purchased, but to our dismay, we ended up tossing the entire case.  We will not be buying these again.  What a letdown...",2
B0015MLVAA,This was my first purchase of any gluten free cheese curls and I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the crunch.  My husband even likes them and he is very picky about his snack foods. To me they taste better than the other name brand cheese curls and with less fat and calories.,5
B0015MLVAA,"Michael Season's baked cheese snacks are in. I don't care if they may be inconsistent with the distribution of cheese on their product, big companies are inconsistent too. Your basketball players don't make every shot, your football players don't make every touch down. Are you whining at them or their coach? No. You deal with it, because despite the flaws, you like them. Natural Snacks LLC from Illinois is providing us with a healthier snack free from glutens and hydrogenated oils, and I'm thankful for that.",5
B0015MLVAA,"Can not be beat. They are simply addictive. Cheesy, spicy crunchy<br />Our family can not stop eating them You have to order these",5
B0015MLVAA,forget cheetos! these are the best ever!  same price (or less if on sale) and better for you.  I could eat a bag by myself but the kids beat me to it!,5
B0015MLVAA,I was very satisfied with the price and quality of the product. I could not find these gluten free cheetos in any store so I was happy to find them online.,5
B0015MLVAA,"I try not to each a lot of processed food, but occasionally I indulge. These are the very best cheese crunchies and gluten free too! I have found these at New Seasons in Portland Oregon every once in a while, but wish they were more readily available. Very good!!!!",5
B0015MLVAA,"The best cheese curl we've found, but we stopped looking once we found these!  Did not think we could consume a case - but, we've back for more.",5
B0015MLVAA,My local grocery store had to stop carrying these because the distributor dropped them. I tried other stores with no luck. These are the only cheese curls that really taste like cheese and don't taste like you're licking salt. I'm so glad I still have a source to get them.,5
B0015MLVAA,"Addictive. IMHO these are simply THE best cheese curls. I used to get them at a local whole foods market. Ordering by the case is a wee bit cheaper, oh-so-convenient and terribly dangerous.",5
B0015MLVAA,"I tried many times to find a replacement for Planters Cheeze Curls (now they discontinued it). And I think that is a perfect replacement. May be not only perfect but better than original from Planters. So, there is lot of cheeze powder on it and size is right and it's so delicious that when you'll put one curl in to you mouth you will involuntarily draw the next two.<br /><br />I'll recommend it for everyone who loved old time Planters Cheeze Curls - it's good and probably better.<br /><br />P.S.: I love them so much so I order them to Russia - total cost with delivery is about 75 dollars!",5
B0015MLVAA,"I'm a secret Cheeto addict, but these baked cheese curls are even more flavorful and addictive than the original.  And they are healthier, which makes them the perfect snack. No artificial cheese flavor, excellent crispy texture and sharp cheese taste.  I'm on my third case now and will continue to order this gem of a snack.  Worth a try if you love cheese curls.",5
B0015MLVAA,"I found this brand of cheese snacks at a Whole Foods store in Manhattan and I've been hooked ever since. Unfortunately, WF started carrying their own brand of cheese puffs and stopped selling Michael Season's. Thank goodness for Amazon.com!<br /><br />I like these so much that I ordered a case and had them delivered to my office. Now all my office mates are getting hooked. These taste amazing for being ""lite"", and they have a decent amount of fiber per serving (and relatively low fat/calories). They are all natural, and highly addictive!<br /><br />I've tried the regular variety of Michael Season's Cheese Puffs, and I do not recommend them because they're too rich. The Lite variety taste perfectly cheesey without being too buttery in flavor.<br /><br />Makes an awesome afternoon snack!",5
B000EGSUMU,"Because this thing is sooo sinfully delicious, any eater is very likely to go through the entire pouch (contains maybe 7-8 joined cashew pieces) in one sitting. And that, according to the nutritional information printed on the back, equals about 940 calories and almost 66 gms (100% of R.D.A.) of total fat and 11 gmss (66%) of saturated fat. My point is this is not a healthy food by any meaning of that word. Also, each pouch has about 22 gms of sugar, which is why I gave it only 4 stars. I think it still would have tasted just as good without that sugar.<br /><br />That said, it is still better than eating most junk snacks that are laden with god knows what and how many artificial abominations. The thing I like the most about this cashew product is it is dry roasted, unlike most brands you find on the supermarket shelves which are fried in oil. Nuts are naturally oily/fatty; there' s no need to deep fry them in oil again. Besides, I think nuts taste better in their raw forms.<br /><br />Finally, I think the label in the package is a little misleading. It reads the product is ""Vegan, cholesterol-free, dairy-free, and wheat- free."" But, isn't that self-evident? It's like saying bottled water is fat and sugar free.",4
B000EGSUMU,Great taste.  I especially like the bite-sized pieces that didn't crumble like peanut brittle and make a mess.,5
B000EGSUMU,Mrs. May's cashew crunch has saved me from eating a whole bag of chips many times!  All I need is a couple of squares of crunch and I'm good to go!  It satisfies my sweet/salty/crunchy cravings all in one and is delicious to boot!,5
B000EGSUMU,"Really good snack. My kids favorite so far. Also, my child with braces can eat these snacks as they are soft enough for her without breaking brackets.",5
B000EGSUMU,I love this product.  It's so tasty and crunchy.  This is really the best cashew crunch I've ever tasted probably because it's dry roasted and not loaded with sugar.  Great snack - very difficult to just eat a few pieces.,5
B000EGSUMU,"Definitely worth the money.  Unfortunately, they are quite addicting.  These nuts are the best thing since sliced bread.  I am so hooked on them. I actually have to fight myself so that I don't order another dozen bags.",5
B000EGSUMU,"I almost wish it wasn't possible to order these in such a large quantity.  Oh well, sometimes sacrifices need to be made.",5
B000EGSUMU,The Cashew Crunch is a very tasty snack.  The flavor of the cashews is not destroyed with a lot of other ingredients.  I love that they are all natural with no artificial colors or flavors.,5
B000EGSUMU,"I first found these in a natural foods store.  This deal on Amazon is great...I am on a scheduled delivery and get a discount and free shipping.  Can't beat that!<br />I use this snack when I make my own trail mix.  I bring it everywhere I go, and the Cashew Crunch always goes first.  Not too much sugar.  There are other varieties, but I keep coming back to this one.",5
B000EGSUMU,"This is my favorite snack.  Pricy, but other than that, a good experience all the way around.",5
B000EGSUMU,I love this product. Crunchy and sweet but not too sweet. Can't get enough. Only negative is it is very hard to stop eating and you can go through a bag in no time.,5
B000EGSUMU,I highly recommend this snack food.  It's a healthy alternative to chips.  It's crunchy and flavorful.  I trust the Mrs. May's brand as they are consistently good.,5
B000EGSUMU,"If you suffer from Celiac, you know that yummy treats are expensive.  There are many flavors that Mrs. May offers, and because they are essentially all nuts, it does not take much to have a satisfying snack or treat after a meal, at a great price.  Also, I am very sugar-sensitive and these fit in well with not disrupting my levels.",5
B000EGSUMU,Mrs. May's is a great snack.  Healthy and delicious.  Not much in it--simple and yummy.,5
B000EGSUMU,I loved Mrs. May's Cashew Crunch. What I didn't love about it was the nutritional information. The pieces it is cut into are very small. They are easily popped into the mouth and in a crunch or two they are gone. So consuming the entire pouch is VERY easy to do! ONE OUNCE of this has 172 calories! 12 grams total fat (2 grams Saturated Fat)! Once ounce is gone so quickly that you'll easily overdo it. This snack may be made with healthier ingredients than the garbage you can buy at the local store but it is in no way healthy to eat this snack. I love it but I'll never eat it again.,2
B000EGSUMU,Thse are one of my most favorite munchies! Nothing but to healthy stuff in there. Better than generic boring granola!,5
B000EGSUMU,"This product is made in China.  I would not believe any claims they make regarding allergy safety and vegan/kosher.  Considering Mrs. May's markets itself as a healthy product, I was shocked when I glanced at the back and noticed this product was made in China. China has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices. Unsafe toys, dog food, and now we're supposed to trust them making our health food?<br /><br />Not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world. I will not buy this product anymore.<br /><br />I would rather purchase the Sahale snacks that are made in the US, even if they are a bit more expensive.",1
B000EGSUMU,"I was a Mrs. May's regular for years.  I ordered a case of their cashew crunch directly from them and it arrived in a box that said:  Made in China.  I wrote them and, to give them credit, unlike most American companies today, they responded honestly and without the typical excuses. They told me they'd produced their products in China for years with no problems.  My dogs were affected by the Chinese dog food poisoning incident and I did not want to subject my family to the possibility of tainted food purchased in the belief I was giving them something healthy. Also, the fuel used to ship these from China to the U.S. makes them less than viable candidates for sustainability. I already work very hard to ensure than things purchased on Amazon come from areas near my home.",1
B000EGSUMU,This is so good I wish it comes in a bigger package!,1
